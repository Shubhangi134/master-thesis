INTRODUCTION
The Government of India felt the need for a permanent agency to expedite the
publication of standards and development of test facilities in parallel when the
work on the preparation of the standards is going on, as the development of
improved safety critical parts can be undertaken only after the publication of the
standard and commissioning of test facilities. To this end, the erstwhile Ministry of
Surface Transport (MOST) has constituted a permanent Automotive Industry
Standard Committee (AISC) vide order No. RT-11028/11/97-MVL dated
September 15, 1997. The standards prepared by AISC will be approved by the
permanent CMVR Technical Standing Committee (CTSC). After approval, the
Automotive Research Association of India, (ARAI), Pune, being the Secretariat of
the AIS Committee, has published this standard. For better dissemination of this
information ARAI may publish this document on their Web site.
This guideline standard on control cables used in automobiles covers construction,
materials, shape, dimensions, testing procedure and requirements.
While preparing this standard considerable assistance is derived from following
standards:
i) JASO F 903 -75: Control Cables for Automobiles
ii) JASO T 001- 97: Control Cables for Motorcycles
The Automotive Industry Standards Committee (AISC) responsible for preparation
of this standard is given in Annexure: 31

EXPLANATORY NOTE ON CONTROL CABLES FOR AUTOMOBILES
Supplementary explanations shall be given in regard to the contents of this
standard. (The following item numbers are identical to those in the text).
3 MAIN COMPONENT MATERIALS AND SURFACE
TREATMENTS
3.1 Inner Cable
(1) In case the corrosion resistance of inner cable is required to be specially
strong, SUS304WR or SUS302WR of JIS G 4308 (Stainless Steel Wire
Rods) is recommended.
(2) For inner cable (coated wire) coating material, selection is made from
polyethylene, polyacetal, polyamide plastics and the like, depending on
the application and type of cable.
3.2 Outer Casing
(1) Polyvinyl chloride is most widely used as coating material for outer
casing but there is increasing demand for heat resistance, cold
resistance, and other special matters and as materials for these purposes,
development is being advanced on various plastics such as
polyethylene, polypropylene and polyamide resins. As a result, only
synthetic resin was designated in this standard so that actual type of
resin and properties shall be as treated as direction to the parties
concerned.
(2) For the outer casing (synthetic resin tube), material mainly used are
polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyacetal resins, but for the same
reason given above, only synthetic resin was designated so as to leave
the details agreed on between the parties concerned.
3.3 Cable End
The material differs depending on the part shape, dimensions, and whether
the connecting method with inner cable is by caulking or casting in, and
selection made from materials such as BsBM of JIS H 3422 (Free Cutting
Brass Rods), S15C ~ 35C of JIS G 4051 (Carbon Steel for Machine
Structural Use) and ZDC of JIS H 5301 (Zinc Alloy Die Castings).

4. SHAPES AND DIMENSIONS OF MAIN COMPONENTS
4.1 Inner Cable (Annexure 1, 2, 3 and 4)
(1) Tolerance
In the tolerances, there are those on the minus side but only those on
plus side were taken, using JIS G 3535 as reference. For nominal
diameter 2.0 and under, plus side 0.1 nominal diameter, and for nominal
diameter 2.5 and above, plus side 0.08 nominal diameter were
established as basis.
(2) Elongation
Since the yield point does not appear clearly in steel stranded cable,
tensile load corresponding to 60 percent of designated breaking load
was added, and indicated with the elongation investigated at that time
as reference.
(3) Inner cable (coated cable)
The minimum wall thickness designated indicates the value that shall
be required for minimum assurance in case of eccentric wall thickness
in resin coating.
4.2 Outer Casing (Annexure 5 and 6)
(1) Standard strand diameter has been indicated here as reference to
express the workability from round wire.
(2) Outer casing (resin tube) is normally formed using single resin but
different resins may be used to form two-layer casing.
4.3 Cable End
(1) It is necessary that the cable end pull off load be a value that satisfies
the operating conditions and safety factor but as this is largely
influenced by the cable end shape and size and inner cable diameter, the
value for cable ends used on same inner cable diameter, as principle, is
set to the same value.
(2) Solder penetration length is defined as the length of the part, in which
during the soldering of the cable end, the solder had been drawn up into
the cable by capillary action and hardened.
(3) When joining the inner cable (coated cable) to cable end, the standard
method is to peel off the coating as indicated below before joining.

(a) Type A cable end (Annexure 7)
Joining method with inner cable is mainly by soldering but those made by die
casting (inner cable cast in) are increasing. On the pull off load, die cast
formed type is generally higher and although this type has little dispersion in
manufacturing, the use of metal mold makes it unsuited for small volume
production.
(b) Type B cable end (Annexure 8)
The method of making up a connector combination with type A or type B
cable end is generally cheaper than type B1, but there is an advantage in
using die cast formed cable end line type B2.
(c) Type C cable end (Annexure 9)
When installing, the type conforming to the shape of companion hardware is
selected.
(d) Type D cable end (Annexure 10)
Type D cable end is utilized when inner cable installed length is to be
adjusted. Caulking method most largely used is square caulking, but other
caulking method may be used if pull off load is satisfied.
4.4 Connector (Annexures 12 and 13)
Connectors will be utilized in combination with cable ends Type A, C or D.
Commonly called clevis. Those that have been standardized are assembled in
with the cables. Some are provided with side hole and slit to enable installing
to cable during vehicle assembly as shown below.

4.5 Casing Cap
(1) Type A casing cap (Annexure 14)
Type A casing cap will be used by fitting into companion hole like
adjust bolt or clamped by suitable companion hardware.
(2) Type B casing cap (Annexure 15)
Type B casing cap will be used by fitting into companion hole and
securing the brim.
(3) Type C casing cap (Annexure 16)
Type C1 is installed on outer casing with double nut to permit adjusting
the length. Type C2 is a general fixed system.
(4) Type D casing cap (Annexure 17 ~ 20)
Type D casing cap will be fitted into companion hole and fixed by use
of wave clip, E ring, needle clip and the like. Classified into Type D1,
D2, and D3 by the method used for fixing. Type D4 is secured by force
fit method.
4.6 Adjust Bolt (Annexure 21)
Adjust Bolt will utilized in combination with Type A casing cap for adjusting
outer casing installed length.
4.7 Adjust Nut (Annexure 22)
As special nut for installing dust cover, Adjust Nut will be used in
combination with Type C casing cap or adjust bolt.
4.8 Casing Protector (Annexure 28)
In regard to length, those exceeding 500 mm were considered to be free.
4.9 Dust Cover (Annexure 29 and 30)
On the tightening of the assembling portion, the inner diameter d that
o
directly cover the inner cable was prescribed to be equal to or slightly smaller
than the inner cable diameter and the inner diameter d that covers the casing
cap or adjust nut at the outer casing side was prescribed to 0.5 mm smaller
than the outer diameter of fitting part.

5. QUALITY
5.1 Dimensions and Tolerance
(1) On proper use of "medium class" and "rough class" in JIS B 0105,
general practice is to use medium class. On lengthwise dimension,
rough class is sometimes used.
(2) On proper use of "Class 2" and "Class 3" in screw thread accuracy,
Class 2 is generally used and on nuts, Class 3 is partially used.
(3) On cable length dimensions, it is desired that these be determined by
outer casing overall length (with cap and inner cable exposed lengths a
+ b. (Main Text Table 5-1). On cable where construction necessitates
use of dust covers at inner cable exposed part, there is difficulty in
bringing the exposed parts to one place for measurement. In regard to
this, it was decided to determine the dimension as inner cable overall
length (with cable end) L indicated in Main Text Table 5-2. On
designating the inner cable nominal length, this may be done to comply
with the individual demand items.
6. TEST METHODS
(1) Load speed in strength test
In the strength tests such as inner cable breaking test and cable end and
casing cap pull-off load test, it is known that high value will be
indicated when the load speed is too fast so that speed not exceeding 50
mm/min. was adopted, taking into consideration working efficiency.
(2) Operating efficiency
It was decided to indicate the operating efficiency in terms of load
efficiency and stroke efficiency.
(a) Load efficiency test
In general, load efficiency indicates better value when the load W
at the operated side is high than when low. This could be
considered as being due to the effects of dust cover tightening
allowance, lubricating oil and grease viscosity, and other being
more readily received. On the operating side load F, considerable
amplitude will be recorded by oscillograph in case of sticking or
slipping. In such cases, the central value should be indicated.
The faster the operating speed at measurement, the greater will
become the amplitude but there will be no transition in the central
value. It could be considered that some relation may exist between
the amplitude size and the operating smoothness or feeling but
this could not be clarified quantitatively.

The load efficiency differs depending on the curved state of the
outer casing. It is known that the following experimental equation
obtained based on the contacting angle of the outer casing and
inner cable at the curvature part shows highly accurate estimation
when the outer casing is bent with in the range of R100 to 300,
this could be utilized as necessary.
n
c-µΣθ
Load efficiency η =
where µ : Coefficient of friction
n
Σθ : Contact angle between outer casing and inner cable
n
In regard to Σθ, examples of single and multiple curves will be
indicated in Explanatory Note Fig. 1.
Explanatory Note Fig. 1
In general the equation will be as follows in case on n number of
multiple curves.
n n
Σθ = nπ - Σθ
When the outer casing curved part is properly supported along a
round plate, it has been found that the load efficiency will be
somewhat improved. This could be considered as being due to the
buckling trend of outer casing being prevented.
It is now becoming a general practice to coat the inner cable with
synthetic resin or utilize synthetic resin tube as means of raising
load efficiency.
(b) Stroke efficiency test
The equation indicated in Main Text 6.1.3 (2) expresses the case
of stroke loss resulting from apparent elastic elongation (inner
cable elastic elongation and outer casing elastic contraction).
Operating play resulting from apparent permanent elongation
(inner cable permanent elongation and outer casing permanent
contraction) is not included.
On the inner cable elongation, measurements can be made with
relative ease, and moreover, the inner cable can be utilized alone.

Taking these into consideration, the reference values and test
method have been indicated in Main Text Annexures 1 and 8.
On the outer casing contraction, casing is difficult to measure by
itself and in addition, it is used in combination with the inner
cable. These have been taken into consideration, resulting in
deciding to represent this by stroke efficiency test prescribed in
Main Text 6.1.3 (2). In the stroke efficiency test, load elongation
curve is derived, and by deriving that for the inner cable
separately, it will be possible to estimate that for the outer casing
alone from the curve.
As a means of raising the stroke efficiency, presetting the strands
in the inner cable is sometimes practiced. By presetting, the
apparent elasticity of the inner cable will be raised but this
amounts to only a few percent and has little effect on improving
the stroke efficiency. It should also be noted that this will not
constitute a positive countermeasure in removing the operating
play.
In case of stranded cable in general, as shown in Explanatory Note
Fig. 2, for the same nominal diameter inner cable, the single has
less elongation than the multi type. For the same load and with
same composition, the larger the nominal diameter, the less will
be elongation. These facts should be taken into consideration.
Explanatory Note Fig. 2
(3) Outer Casing Buckling
When tensile operating load is impressed, the outer casing is subjected to
compressive load and may indicate buckling trend.
Functional impedance caused by buckling would first of all be loss in stroke
efficiency. Aside from this, if the buckling becomes large enough to make it
difficult to return to original shape, it could result in improper operation.
According to the results of various observations, it was found that buckling
had adverse effect on load efficiency and control feeling.

The general tendency for buckling to develop has been found to start by
buckling in installed surface outer direction, followed by inside surface, and
when both occur, the operating efficiency drops.
When at surface outer buckling, elastic recovery is generally possible but
surface inner buckling is sometimes accompanied by permanent deformation.
On synthetic resin tubes, studies have shown that smaller the outer casing
sectional secondary moment and larger the curve R, the smaller will be the
buckling development load. This has been proved both theoretically and
experimentally.
As related above, development of buckling is not functionally desirable. It is
necessary to know the pattern of its development but on the general handling
of the test method, it would be difficult to define at what point of the
buckling deformation the limiting load should be taken. Also, when
maximum diameter inner cables were inserted into outer casings of the sizes
recommended in this standard, and with tension up to cable breaking load
applied under the condition of 90o bend, 180 o bend and 90o successive bends
over R 100 ~ 300 curves, no symptoms such as inability to recover elasticity
could be observed. Such being the case, test method was not specially
prescribed in this standard. However, if it is considered that buckling is
mainly developed as an effect of operating efficiency, investigation could be
made by detailed performance of operating efficiency test.
Thus, if the operating function should become a special problem or in case of
special application, individual investigation should be made. In the case of
utilizing synthetic resin tube for outer casing, precaution should be taken
since the bending strength is generally low.
(4) Control Feeling
In the control cable functions, aside from operating efficiency, control feeling
or operating smoothness becomes a problem.
As a cause for decling in feeling, sticking slipping symptoms can be listed
first. The most effective countermeasure for this would be to plan on
lowering the friction. For this, studies in lubrication grease selection and
effects of temperature and operating speed would be required. There are also
cases where the problem of resonance in the elastic properties of inner cable,
outer casing and installation parts have been considered.
In regard to feeling, it would be difficult to indicate this by numerical value
at the present stage. Aside from special examples, this is still in the research
stage and is a problem that should be investigated further.

In relation to the buckling and feeling mentioned above, bending rigidity of
the outer casing becomes a factor. As a simple test method for this, the free
bending of a given length outer casing is supported as a cantilever beam is
compared.
(5) Control Cable Seal
On the preservation of control cable durability, main factors are outer casing
cover maintenance and effectiveness of seals such as dust covers. As a means
of raising the sealing property of dust cover, a method widely used is to
clamp both ends of the dust cover with steel or aluminum rings. Aside from
this, use of packing material such as felt is also utilized.
(6) Functional Deterioration and Longevity by Repeated Operation
Repeated operation and also accumulation of running operational conditions
including environmental changes will generally cause deterioration in
operating functions. Especially with the lowering of operating efficiency and
feeling, operation could become impossible even though inner cable and
outer casing remain unbroken.
The subjects that become the object of investigation include the longevity of
inner cable and cable ends under corrosion or frictional conditions, apparent
accumulative elongation of the inner cable, accumulative elongation of outer
casing, changes in frictional resistance and lubricating function, and
performance and longevity of the various seals.
