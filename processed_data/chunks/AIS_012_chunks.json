No. nda. ment General Remarks : II INTRODUCTION The Government of India felt the need for a permanent agency to expedite the publication of standards and development of test facilities in parallel when the work on the preparation of the standards is going on, as the development of improved safety critical parts can be undertaken only after the publication of the standard and commissioning of test facilities. To this end, the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST) vide order No. RT-11028/11/97-MVL dated September 15,1997.The standard prepared by AISC will be approved by the permanent CMVR Technical Standing Committee (CTSC). After approval, the Automotive Research Association of India,(ARAI), Pune , being the Secretariat of the AIS Committee, has published this standard . For better dissemination of this information ARAI may publish this document on their Web site. Performance of lighting and light-signalling devices is a safety requirement. This standard prescribes the requirements of such devices installed on motor vehicle having more than three wheels, trailer and semi-trailer . Performance requirements of lighting and light-signalling devices for two and three wheeler are covered in AIS-010 and those for agricultural tractor are covered in AIS-062. Performance requirements for retro-reflectors to be installed on motor vehicles are covered in AIS-057 Considerable assistance has been taken from the following ECE Regulations",

If this value exceeds 3.0 mrad but is not more than 4.0 mrad, the second front fog lamp of sample A shall be subjected to the test after which the mean of the absolute values recorded on both samples shall not exceed 3.0 mrad. However, if this value of 3.0 mrad on sample A is not complied with, the two front fog lamps of sample B shall be subjected to the same procedure and the value of (cid:507)r for each of them shall not exceed 3.0 mrad.

E2.2.1.1 All measurements on lamps equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V respectively. In the case of light sources supplied by a special power supply, the above test voltages shall be applied to the input terminals of that power supply. The test laboratory may require from the manufacturer the special power supply needed to supply the light sources. E2.2.2.
