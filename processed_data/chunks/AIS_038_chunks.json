No. ment General Remarks: Introduction The Government of India felt the need for a permanent agency to expedite the publication of Standards and development of test facilities in parallel when the work of preparation of Standards is going on, as the development of improved safety critical parts can be undertaken only after the publication of the Standard and commissioning of test facilities. To this end, the Ministry of Surface Transport (MoST) has constituted a permanent Automotive Industry Standard Committee (AISC) vide order no. RT-11028/11/97-MVL dated September 15, 1997. The Standards prepared by AISC will be approved by the permanent CMVR Technical Standing Committee (CTSC) after approval, The Automotive Research Association of India, (ARAI), Pune, being the secretariat of the AIS Committee, has published this Standard. For better dissemination of this information, ARAI may publish this document on their website. This Standard prescribes the requirements for the construction and functional safety of battery operated vehicles. Considerable assistance has been taken from ECE 100, ISO DIS 6469 and IEC 60529. The Committee responsible for preparation of this standard is given in Annexure- 4.
