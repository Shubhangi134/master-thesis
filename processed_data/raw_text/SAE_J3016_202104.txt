(R) Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to
Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles
RATIONALE
This revision of SAE J3016 was undertaken in close cooperation between the SAE On-Road Automated Driving (ORAD)
Committee and ISO TC204/WG14 through a Joint Working Group formed in 2018. This collaboration brought to bear the
knowledge and expertise of global experts in driving automation technology and safety. Several new terms and definitions
have been added and multiple corrections and clarifications have been made to address frequently misunderstood concepts
and improve the utility of the document, especially for non-native English speakers. As in the previous version, it provides
a taxonomy describing the full range of levels of driving automation in on-road motor vehicles and includes functional
definitions for advanced levels of driving automation and related terms and definitions. This document does not provide
specifications, or otherwise impose requirements on, driving automation systems (for further elaboration, see 8.1).
Standardizing levels of driving automation and supporting terms serves several purposes, including:
1. Clarifying the role of the (human) driver, if any, during driving automation system engagement.
2. Answering questions of scope when it comes to developing laws, policies, regulations, and standards.
3. Providing a useful framework for driving automation specifications and technical requirements.
4. Providing clarity and stability in communications on the topic of driving automation, as well as a useful short-hand that
saves considerable time and effort.
This document has been developed according to the following guiding principles; namely, it should:
1. Be descriptive and informative rather than normative.
2. Provide functional definitions.
3. Be consistent with current industry practice.
4. Be consistent with prior art to the extent practicable.
5. Be useful across disciplines, including engineering, law, media, and public discourse.
6. Be clear and cogent and, as such, it should avoid or define ambiguous terms.

FOREWORD
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member
bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each
member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented
on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in
the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
standardization.
SAE International is a global association of more than 128000 engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace,
automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries. Standards from SAE International are used to advance mobility engineering
throughout the world. The SAE Technical Standards Development Program is among the organization's primary provisions
to those mobility industries it serves aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle. These works are authorized, revised,
and maintained by the volunteer efforts of more than 9000 engineers, and other qualified professionals from around the
world. SAE subject matter experts act as individuals in the standards process, not as representatives of their organizations.
Thus, SAE standards represent optimal technical content developed in a transparent, open, and collaborative process.
The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC
Directives, Part 1 and the SAE Technical Standards Board Policy. In particular, the different approval criteria needed for the
different types of ISO documents should be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of the
ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 (refer to www.iso.org/directives).

1. SCOPE
This document describes [motor] vehicle driving automation systems that perform part or all of the dynamic driving task
(DDT) on a sustained basis. It provides a taxonomy with detailed definitions for six levels of driving automation, ranging
from no driving automation (Level 0) to full driving automation (Level 5), in the context of [motor] vehicles (hereafter also
referred to as “vehicle” or “vehicles”) and their operation on roadways:
Level 0: No Driving Automation
Level 1: Driver Assistance
Level 2: Partial Driving Automation
Level 3: Conditional Driving Automation
Level 4: High Driving Automation
Level 5: Full Driving Automation
These level definitions, along with additional supporting terms and definitions provided herein, can be used to describe the
full range of driving automation features equipped on [motor] vehicles in a functionally consistent and coherent manner.
“On-road” refers to publicly accessible roadways (including parking areas and private campuses that permit public access)
that collectively serve all road users, including cyclists, pedestrians, and users of vehicles with and without driving
automation features.
The levels apply to the driving automation feature(s) that are engaged in any given instance of on-road operation of an
equipped vehicle. As such, although a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of
delivering multiple driving automation features that perform at different levels, the level of driving automation exhibited in
any given instance is determined by the feature(s) that are engaged.
This document also refers to three primary actors in driving: the (human) user, the driving automation system, and other
vehicle systems and components. These other vehicle systems and components (or the vehicle in general terms) do not
include the driving automation system in this model, even though as a practical matter a driving automation system may
actually share hardware and software components with other vehicle systems, such as a processing module(s) or operating
code.
The levels of driving automation are defined by reference to the specific role played by each of the three primary actors in
performance of the DDT and/or DDT fallback. “Role” in this context refers to the expected role of a given primary actor,
based on the design of the driving automation system in question and not necessarily to the actual performance of a given
primary actor. For example, a driver who fails to monitor the roadway during engagement of a Level 1 adaptive cruise control
(ACC) system still has the role of driver, even while s/he is neglecting it.
Active safety systems, such as electronic stability control (ESC) and automatic emergency braking (AEB), and certain types
of driver assistance systems, such as lane keeping assistance (LKA), are excluded from the scope of this driving automation
taxonomy because they do not perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis, but rather provide momentary
intervention during potentially hazardous situations. Due to the momentary nature of the actions of active safety systems,
their intervention does not change or eliminate the role of the driver in performing part or all of the DDT, and thus are not
considered to be driving automation, even though they perform automated functions. In addition, systems that inform, alert,
or warn the driver about hazards in the driving environment are also outside the scope of this driving automation taxonomy,
as they neither automate part or all of the DDT, nor change the driver’s role in performance of the DDT (see 8.13).
It should be noted, however, that crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be
included in vehicles equipped with driving automation systems at any level. For automated driving system (ADS) features
(i.e., Levels 3 to 5) that perform the complete DDT, crash mitigation and avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality
(see also 8.13).

3. DEFINITIONS
3.1 ACTIVE SAFETY SYSTEM (SAE J3063)
Active safety systems are vehicle systems that sense and monitor conditions inside and outside the vehicle for the purpose
of identifying perceived present and potential dangers to the vehicle, occupants, and/or other road users, and automatically
intervene to help avoid or mitigate potential collisions via various methods, including alerts to the driver, vehicle system
adjustments, and/or active control of the vehicle subsystems (brakes, throttle, suspension, etc.).
NOTE: For purposes of this report, systems that meet the definition of active safety systems are considered to have a
design purpose that is primarily focused on improving safety rather than comfort, convenience, or general driver
assistance. Active safety systems warn or intervene during a high-risk event or maneuver.
3.2 AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM (ADS)
The hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing the entire DDT on a sustained basis, regardless of
whether it is limited to a specific operational design domain (ODD); this term is used specifically to describe a Level 3, 4,
or 5 driving automation system.
NOTE: In contrast to ADS, the generic term “driving automation system” (see 3.6) refers to any Level 1 to 5 system or
feature that performs part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis. Given the similarity between the generic term,
“driving automation system,” and the Level 3 to 5 specific term, “automated driving system,” the latter term should
be capitalized when spelled out and reduced to its abbreviation, ADS, as much as possible, while the former term
should not be.
3.3 [DRIVERLESS OPERATION] DISPATCHING ENTITY
An entity that dispatches an ADS-equipped vehicle(s) in driverless operation.
NOTE: The functions carried out by a dispatching entity may be divided among one or several agents, depending on the
usage specification for the ADS-equipped vehicle(s) in question.
EXAMPLE: A fleet of Level 4 closed campus ADS-dedicated vehicles is placed into service by a driverless operation
dispatching entity, which engages the ADS for each vehicle after verifying its operational readiness and
disengages the ADS when each vehicle is taken out of service.
3.4 DISPATCH [IN DRIVERLESS OPERATION]
To place an ADS-equipped vehicle into service in driverless operation by engaging the ADS.
NOTE 1: The term “dispatch,” as used outside of the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, is generally understood to mean
sending a particular vehicle to a particular pick-up or drop-off location for purposes of providing a transportation
service. In the context of ADS-equipped vehicles, and as used herein, this term includes software-enabled
dispatch of multiple ADS-equipped vehicles in driverless operation that may complete multiple trips involving
pick-up and drop-off of passengers or goods throughout a day or other pre-defined period of service, and which
may involve multiple agents performing various tasks related to the dispatch function. In order to highlight this
specialized use of the term dispatch, the term is modified and conditioned by the stipulation that it refers
exclusively to dispatching vehicles in driverless operation.
NOTE 2: Only ADS-equipped vehicles capable of driverless operation (namely, an ADS-DV or a dual-mode vehicle) are
potentially subject to being dispatched.

3.5 DRIVING AUTOMATION
The performance by hardware/software systems of part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis.
3.6 DRIVING AUTOMATION SYSTEM OR TECHNOLOGY
The hardware and software that are collectively capable of performing part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis; this term
is used generically to describe any system capable of Level 1 to 5 driving automation.
NOTE: In contrast to this generic term for any Level 1 to 5 system, the specific term for a Level 3 to 5 system is “automated
driving system (ADS).” Given the similarity between the generic term, “driving automation system,” and the Level 3
to 5 specific term, “Automated Driving System,” the latter term should be capitalized when spelled out and reduced
to its abbreviation, ADS, as much as possible, while the former term should not be (see 3.2).
3.7 [DRIVING AUTOMATION SYSTEM] FEATURE
A Level 1-5 driving automation system’s design-specific functionality at a given level of driving automation within a particular
ODD, if applicable.
NOTE 1: Because the term “driving automation system” subsumes both driver support features and ADS features, it is also
acceptable to refer to them as such.
NOTE 2: A given driving automation system may have multiple features, each associated with a particular level of driving
automation and ODD.
NOTE 3: Each feature satisfies a usage specification.
NOTE 4: Features may be referred to by generic names (e.g., automated parking) or by proprietary names.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 3 ADS feature that performs the DDT, excluding DDT fallback, in high-volume traffic on fully
access-controlled freeways.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 4 ADS feature that performs the DDT, including DDT fallback, in a specified geo-fenced urban center.
3.7.1 MANEUVER-BASED FEATURE
A driving automation system feature equipped on a conventional vehicle that either:
1. Supports the driver by executing a limited set of lateral and/or longitudinal vehicle motion control actions sufficient to
fulfil a specific, narrowly defined use case (e.g., parking maneuver), while the driver performs the rest of the DDT and
supervises the Level 1 or Level 2 feature’s performance (i.e., Level 1 or Level 2 driver support features);
or
2. Executes a limited set of lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control actions, as well as associated object and event
detection and response (OEDR) and all other elements of the complete DDT in order to fulfil a specific, narrowly defined
use case without human supervision (Level 3 or 4 ADS features).
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 1 parking assistance feature automatically performs the lateral vehicle motion control actions
necessary to parallel park a vehicle, while the driver performs the longitudinal vehicle motion control actions
and supervises the feature.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 2 parking assistance feature automatically performs the lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control
actions necessary to parallel park a vehicle under the supervision of the driver.
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 3 highway overtaking assistance feature automatically performs the lateral and longitudinal vehicle
motion control actions, as well as associated OEDR, necessary to pass a slower-moving vehicle on a
multi-lane highway when activated by the driver or fallback-ready user.

SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 8 of 41
3.7.2 SUB-TRIP FEATURE
A driving automation system feature equipped on a conventional vehicle that requires a human driver to perform the
complete DDT for at least part of every trip.
NOTE: Sub-trip features require a human driver to operate the vehicle between the point-of-origin and the boundary of the
feature’s ODD and/or after leaving the feature’s ODD until the destination is reached (i.e., trip completion).
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) feature performs longitudinal vehicle motion control functions to
support the driver in maintaining consistent headway to a lead vehicle in its lane when travelling at higher
speeds.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 2 highway feature performs lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control functions to support the
driver in maintaining position within its lane of travel, as well as consistent headway to a lead vehicle in its
lane when travelling at higher speeds.
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 3 traffic jam feature performs the complete DDT on a fully access-controlled freeway in dense traffic,
but requires a human driver to operate the vehicle upon ODD exit (e.g., when traffic clears, as well as before
entering the congested freeway, and again upon exiting it).
EXAMPLE 4: During a given vehicle trip, a user with a Level 4 automated parking feature dispatches the vehicle in driverless
operation for the purpose of finding a parking space in a nearby designated parking facility. Following a period
of shopping, the user retrieves the vehicle via dispatch in order to begin his/her trip home.
3.7.3 FULL-TRIP FEATURE
ADS features that operate a vehicle throughout complete trips.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 4 ADS-DV is dispatched in driverless operation for purposes of providing ride-hailing services to
customers located within its geo-fenced area of operation.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 5 dual-mode vehicle is dispatched in driverless operation by its owner to go to a designated airport,
pick up several family members, and bring them home. All vehicle occupants remain passengers throughout
the return trip.
Figure 1 illustrates how a trip could be completed by use of various combinations of driving automation features engaged
at different levels of driving automation.

3.8 DRIVER SUPPORT [DRIVING AUTOMATION SYSTEM] FEATURE
A general term for Level 1 and Level 2 driving automation system features.
NOTE: Level 1 (driver assistance) and Level 2 (partial automation) features are capable of performing only part of the DDT,
and thus require a driver to perform the remainder of the DDT, as well as to supervise the feature’s performance
while engaged. As such, these features, when engaged, support—but do not replace—a driver in performing the
DDT.
3.9 DRIVERLESS OPERATION [OF AN ADS-EQUIPPED VEHICLE]
On-road operation of an ADS-equipped vehicle that is unoccupied, or in which on-board users are not drivers or in-vehicle
fallback-ready users.
NOTE 1: ADS-DVs are always dispatched in driverless operation (subject to NOTE 3 in 3.33.3).
NOTE 2: ADS-equipped dual-mode vehicles may be dispatched in driverless operation.
NOTE 3: On-board passengers are neither drivers nor fallback-ready users.
EXAMPLE: A Level 4 ADS-DV is dispatched in driverless operation for purposes of providing transportation service.
3.10 DYNAMIC DRIVING TASK (DDT)
All of the real-time operational and tactical functions required to operate a vehicle in on-road traffic, excluding the strategic
functions such as trip scheduling and selection of destinations and waypoints, and including, without limitation, the following
subtasks:
1. Lateral vehicle motion control via steering (operational).
2. Longitudinal vehicle motion control via acceleration and deceleration (operational).
3. Monitoring the driving environment via object and event detection, recognition, classification, and response preparation
(operational and tactical).
4. Object and event response execution (operational and tactical).
5. Maneuver planning (tactical).
6. Enhancing conspicuity via lighting, sounding the horn, signaling, gesturing, etc. (tactical).
NOTE 1: Some driving automation systems (or the vehicles equipped with them) may have a means to change longitudinal
vehicle motion control between forward and reverse.
NOTE 2: For simplification and to provide a useful shorthand term, subtasks (3) and (4) are referred to collectively as object
and event detection and response (OEDR) (see 3.19).
NOTE 3: In this document, reference is made to “complete(ing) the DDT.” This means fully performing all of the subtasks
of the DDT, whether that role is fulfilled by the (human) driver, by the driving automation system, or by a
combination of both.
NOTE 4: Figure 2 displays a schematic view of the driving task. For more information on the differences between
operational, tactical, and strategic functions of driving, see 8.11.

SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 10 of 41
Figure 2 - Schematic (not a control diagram) view of driving task showing DDT portion
For purposes of DDT performance, Level 1 driving automation encompasses automation of part of the innermost loop (i.e.,
either lateral vehicle motion control functionality or longitudinal vehicle motion control functionality and limited OEDR
associated with the given axis of vehicle motion control); Level 2 driving automation encompasses automation of the
innermost loop (lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control and limited OEDR associated with vehicle motion control),
and Level 3 to 5 driving automation encompasses automation of both inner loops (lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion
control and complete OEDR). Note that DDT performance does not include strategic aspects of driving (e.g., determining
whether, when, and where to travel).
3.11 FAILURE MITIGATION STRATEGY
A vehicle function (not an ADS function) designed to automatically bring an ADS-equipped vehicle to a controlled stop in
path following either: (1) prolonged failure of the fallback-ready user of a Level 3 ADS feature to perform the fallback after
the ADS has issued a request to intervene, or (2) occurrence of a system failure or external event so catastrophic that it
incapacitates the ADS, which can no longer perform vehicle motion control in order to perform the fallback and achieve a
minimal risk condition. (See 8.6.)
NOTE: Some vehicles equipped with Level 2 driver support features may be designed to brake a vehicle to a full stop if the
driver fails to indicate his/her continued supervision of feature performance during engagement. Although that is
similar in function to a failure mitigation strategy as defined above, the term “failure mitigation strategy” is reserved
for ADS features that do not require driver supervision.
3.12 [DYNAMIC DRIVING TASK (DDT)] FALLBACK
The response by the user to either perform the DDT or achieve a minimal risk condition (1) after occurrence of a DDT
performance-relevant system failure(s), or (2) upon operational design domain (ODD) exit, or the response by an ADS to
achieve minimal risk condition, given the same circumstances.
NOTE 1: The DDT and the DDT fallback are distinct functions, and the capability to perform one does not necessarily entail
the ability to perform the other. Thus, a Level 3 ADS, which is capable of performing the entire DDT within its
ODD, may not be capable of performing the DDT fallback in all situations that require it and thus will issue a
request to intervene to the DDT fallback-ready user when necessary (see Figures 3 to 6).

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 11 of 41
NOTE 2: Some Level 3 features may be designed to automatically perform the fallback and achieve a minimal risk condition
in some circumstances, such as when an obstacle-free, adjacent shoulder is present, but not in others, such as
when no such road shoulder is available. The assignment of Level 3 therefore does not restrict the ADS from
automatically achieving the minimal risk condition, but it cannot guarantee automated achievement of minimal
risk condition in all cases within its ODD. Moreover, automated minimal risk condition achievement in some, but
not all, circumstances that demand it does not constitute Level 4 functionality.
NOTE 3: At Level 3, an ADS is capable of continuing to perform the DDT for at least several seconds after providing the
fallback-ready user with a request to intervene. The DDT fallback-ready user is then expected to resume manual
vehicle operation, or to achieve a minimal risk condition if s/he determines it to be necessary.
NOTE 4: At Levels 4 and 5, the ADS must be capable of performing the DDT fallback and achieving a minimal risk condition.
Level 4 and 5 ADS-equipped vehicles that are designed to also accommodate operation by a driver (whether
in-vehicle or remote) may allow a user to perform the DDT fallback, when circumstances allow this to be done
safely, if s/he chooses to do so (see Figures 7 and 8). However, a Level 4 or 5 ADS need not be designed to
allow a user to perform DDT fallback and, indeed, may be designed to disallow it in order to reduce crash risk
(see 8.9).
NOTE 5: While a Level 4 or 5 ADS is performing the DDT fallback, it may be limited by design in speed and/or range of
lateral and/or longitudinal vehicle motion control (i.e., it may enter so-called “limp-home mode”).
NOTE 6: While performing DDT fallback, an ADS may operate temporarily outside of its ODD (see 3.21 NOTE 1).
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) feature experiences a system failure that causes the feature to stop
performing its intended function. The human driver performs the DDT fallback by resuming performance of
the complete DDT.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 3 ADS feature that performs the entire DDT during traffic jams on freeways is not able to do so when
it encounters a crash scene and therefore issues a request to intervene to the DDT fallback-ready user. S/he
responds by taking over performance of the entire DDT in order to maneuver around the crash scene (see
Figure 4). (Note that in this example, a minimal risk condition is not needed or achieved.)
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 4 ADS-dedicated vehicle (ADS-DV) that performs the entire DDT within a geo-fenced city center
experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure. In response, the ADS-DV performs the DDT fallback
by turning on the hazard flashers, maneuvering the vehicle to the road shoulder and parking it, before
automatically summoning emergency assistance (see Figure 7). (Note that in this example, the ADS-DV
automatically achieves a minimal risk condition.)
The following Figures 3 through 8 illustrate DDT fallback at various levels of driving automation.

seat (if available) to resume DDT performance; if no driver’s seat with receptive passenger, the ADS automatically achieves
a minimal risk condition.

3.13 FLEET OPERATIONS [FUNCTIONS]
The activities that support the management of a fleet of ADS-equipped vehicles in driverless operation, which may include,
without limitation:
• Ensuring operational readiness.
• Dispatching ADS-equipped vehicles in driverless operation (i.e., engaging the ADSs prior to placing the vehicles in
service on public roads).
• Authorizing each trip (e.g., payment, trip route selection).
• Providing fleet asset management services to vehicles while in-use (e.g., managing emergencies, summoning or
providing remote assistance as needed, responding to customer requests and break-downs).
• Serving as the responsible agent vis-a-vis law enforcement, emergency responders and other authorities for vehicles
while in use.
• Disengaging the ADS at the end of service.
• Performing vehicle repair and maintenance as needed.
3.14 LATERAL VEHICLE MOTION CONTROL
The DDT subtask comprising the activities necessary for the real-time, sustained regulation of the y-axis component of
vehicle motion (see Figure 9).
NOTE: Lateral vehicle motion control includes the detection of the vehicle positioning relative to lane boundaries and
application of steering and/or differential braking inputs to maintain appropriate lateral positioning.
3.15 LONGITUDINAL VEHICLE MOTION CONTROL
The DDT subtask comprising the activities necessary for the real-time, sustained regulation of the x-axis component of
vehicle motion (see Figure 9).
NOTE: Longitudinal vehicle motion control may include forward and reverse directionality depending on the usage
specification.

3.16 MINIMAL RISK CONDITION
A stable, stopped condition to which a user or an ADS may bring a vehicle after performing the DDT fallback in order to
reduce the risk of a crash when a given trip cannot or should not be continued.
NOTE 1: At Levels 1 and 2, the in-vehicle driver is expected to achieve a minimal risk condition as needed.
NOTE 2: At Level 3, given a DDT performance-relevant system failure in the ADS or vehicle, the DDT fallback-ready user
is expected to achieve a minimal risk condition when s/he determines that it is necessary, or to otherwise perform
the DDT if the vehicle is operable.
NOTE 3: At Levels 4 and 5, the ADS is capable of automatically achieving a minimal risk condition when necessary (i.e.,
due to ODD exit, if applicable, or due to a DDT performance-relevant system failure in the ADS or vehicle). The
characteristics of automated achievement of a minimal risk condition at Levels 4 and 5 will vary according to the
type and extent of the system failure, the ODD (if any) for the ADS feature in question, and the particular operating
conditions when the system failure or ODD exit occurs. It may entail automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop
within its current travel path, or it may entail a more extensive maneuver designed to remove the vehicle from an
active lane of traffic and/or to automatically return the vehicle to a dispatching facility.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 4 ADS feature designed to operate a vehicle at high speeds on freeways experiences a DDT
performance-relevant system failure and automatically removes the vehicle from active lanes of traffic before
coming to a stop.
EXAMPLE 2: A vehicle in which a Level 4 ADS is installed experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure in its
primary electrical power system. The ADS utilizes a backup power source in order to achieve a minimal risk
condition.
3.17 [DDT PERFORMANCE-RELEVANT] SYSTEM FAILURE
A malfunction in a driving automation system and/or other vehicle system that prevents the driving automation system from
reliably performing its portion of the DDT on a sustained basis, including the complete DDT, that it would otherwise perform.
NOTE 1: This definition applies to vehicle fault conditions and driving automation system failures that prevent a driving
automation system from performing at full capability according to design intention.
NOTE 2: This term does not apply to transient lapses in performance by a Level 1 or 2 driver support feature that are due
to inherent design limitations and that do not otherwise prevent the system from performing its part of the DDT
on a sustained basis.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 1 driver support feature that performs the lateral vehicle motion control subtask of the DDT
experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure in one of its cameras, which prevents it from reliably
detecting lane markings. The feature causes a malfunction indication message to be displayed in the center
console at the same time that the feature automatically disengages, requiring the driver to immediately
resume performing the lateral vehicle motion control subtask of the DDT.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 3 ADS experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure in one of its radar sensors, which
prevents it from reliably detecting objects in the vehicle’s pathway. The ADS responds by issuing a request
to intervene to the DDT fallback-ready user. The ADS continues to perform the DDT, while reducing vehicle
speed, for several seconds to allow time for the DDT fallback-ready user to resume operation of the vehicle
in an orderly manner.
EXAMPLE 3: A vehicle with an engaged Level 3 ADS experiences a sudden tire blow-out, which causes the vehicle to
handle very poorly, giving the fallback-ready user ample kinesthetic feedback indicating a vehicle malfunction
necessitating intervention. The fallback-ready user responds by resuming the DDT, turning on the hazard
lamps, and pulling the vehicle onto the closest road shoulder, thereby achieving a minimal risk condition.
EXAMPLE 4: A Level 4 ADS experiences a DDT performance-relevant system failure in one of its computing modules. The
ADS transitions to DDT fallback by engaging a redundant computing module(s) to achieve a minimal risk
condition.

3.18 MONITOR
A general term describing a range of functions involving real-time human or machine sensing and processing of data used
to operate a vehicle, or to support its operation.
NOTE 1: The terms below describing types of monitoring should be used when the general term “monitor” and its
derivatives are insufficiently precise.
NOTE 2: The following four terms (1 - monitor the user, 2 - monitor the driving environment, 3 - monitor vehicle
performance, and 4 - monitor driving automation system performance) describe categories of monitoring (see
scope regarding primary actors).
NOTE 3: The driver state or condition of being receptive to alerts or other indicators of a DDT performance-relevant system
failure, as assumed in Level 3, is not a form of monitoring. The difference between receptivity and monitoring is
best illustrated by example: A person who becomes aware of a fire alarm or a telephone ringing may not
necessarily have been monitoring the fire alarm or the telephone. Likewise, a user who becomes aware of a trailer
hitch falling off may not necessarily have been monitoring the trailer hitch. By contrast, a driver in a vehicle with
an active Level 1 adaptive cruise control (ACC) system is expected to monitor both the driving environment and
the ACC performance and otherwise not to wait for an alert to draw his/her attention to a situation requiring a
response (see 3.22).
3.18.1 MONITOR THE USER
The activities and/or automated routines designed to assess whether and to what degree the user is performing the role
specified for him/her.
NOTE 1: User monitoring in the context of driving automation is most likely to be deployed as a countermeasure for misuse
or abuse (including over-reliance due to complacency) of a driving automation system, but may also be used for
other purposes.
NOTE 2: User monitoring is primarily useful for Levels 2 and 3, as evidence from the field on the use of Level 1 features
has not identified significant incidence of misuse or abuse of driving automation technology, and above these
levels, the ADS is by definition capable of achieving a minimal risk condition automatically.
3.18.2 MONITOR THE DRIVING ENVIRONMENT
The activities and/or automated routines that accomplish real-time roadway environmental object and event detection,
recognition, classification, and response preparation (excluding actual response), as needed to operate a vehicle.
NOTE: When operating conventional vehicles that are not equipped with an engaged ADS, drivers visually sample the road
scene sufficiently to competently perform the DDT while also performing secondary tasks that require short periods
of eyes-off-road time (e.g., adjusting cabin comfort settings, scanning road signs, tuning a radio, etc.). Thus,
monitoring the driving environment does not necessarily entail continuous eyes-on-road time by the driver.
3.18.3 MONITOR VEHICLE PERFORMANCE [FOR DDT PERFORMANCE-RELEVANT SYSTEM FAILURES]
The activities and/or automated routines that accomplish real-time evaluation of the vehicle performance, and response
preparation, as needed to operate a vehicle.
NOTE: While performing the DDT, Level 4 and 5 ADSs monitor vehicle performance. However, for Level 3 ADSs, as well
as for Level 1 and 2 driving automation systems, the human driver is assumed to be receptive to vehicle conditions
that adversely affect performance of the DDT (see 3.22).
EXAMPLE 1: While a Level 2 driver support feature is engaged in stop-and-go traffic, a malfunctioning brake caliper causes
the vehicle to pull slightly to the left when the brakes are applied. The human driver observes that the vehicle
is deviating from its lane and either corrects the vehicle’s lateral position or disengages the feature entirely.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 17 of 41
EXAMPLE 2: While a Level 4 ADS is engaged in stop-and-go traffic, a malfunctioning brake caliper causes the vehicle to
pull to the left when the brakes are applied. The ADS recognizes this deviation, corrects the vehicle’s lateral
position and transitions to a limp-home mode until it achieves a minimal risk condition.
3.18.4 MONITOR DRIVING AUTOMATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
The activities and/or automated routines for evaluating whether the driving automation system is performing part or all of
the DDT appropriately.
NOTE 1: The term monitor driving automation system performance should not be used in lieu of supervise, which includes
both monitoring and responding as needed to perform the DDT and is therefore more comprehensive.
NOTE 2: Recognizing requests to intervene issued by a driving automation system is not a form of monitoring driving
automation system performance, but rather a form of receptivity.
NOTE 3: At Levels 1 and 2, the driver monitors the driver support feature’s performance as part of supervising.
NOTE 4: At higher levels of driving automation (Levels 3 to 5), the ADS monitors its own performance of the complete
DDT.
EXAMPLE 1: An in-vehicle driver monitors an engaged ACC feature to verify that it is maintaining an appropriate gap while
following a preceding vehicle in a curve.
EXAMPLE 2: A remote driver engaging a Level 2 automated parking feature monitors the pathway of the vehicle to verify
that the feature is responsive to pedestrians and obstacles.
3.19 OBJECT AND EVENT DETECTION AND RESPONSE (OEDR)
The subtasks of the DDT that include monitoring the driving environment (detecting, recognizing, and classifying objects
and events and preparing to respond as needed) and executing an appropriate response to such objects and events (i.e., as
needed to complete the DDT and/or DDT fallback).
3.20 OPERATE [A MOTOR VEHICLE]
Collectively, the activities performed by a (human) driver (with or without support from one or more Level 1 or 2 driving
automation features) or by an ADS (Level 3 to 5) to perform the entire DDT for a given vehicle.
NOTE 1: The term “drive” is not used in this document, however, in many cases it could be used correctly in lieu of
“operate.”
NOTE 2: Although use of the term operate/operating/operation implies the existence of a vehicle “operator,” this term is
not defined or used in this document, which otherwise provides very specific terms and definitions for the various
types of ADS-equipped vehicle users (see 3.32).
NOTE 3: Terms such as “drive,” “operate,” “driver,” and “operator” may have legal meanings that are different from their
technical meanings, as contained in this document.
3.21 OPERATIONAL DESIGN DOMAIN (ODD)
Operating conditions under which a given driving automation system or feature thereof is specifically designed to function,
including, but not limited to, environmental, geographical, and time-of-day restrictions, and/or the requisite presence or
absence of certain traffic or roadway characteristics.
NOTE 1: While Level 3 and 4 ADS features/vehicles are designed to operate exclusively within their respective ODDs,
some ODD conditions are subject to rapid change during on-road operation (e.g., inclement weather, obscured
lane lines). Such transient changes in the operating environment do not necessarily represent an “ODD exit,” as
the ADS determines when such a change in conditions requires fallback performance (whether by the fallback-
ready user or ADS).

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 18 of 41
NOTE 2: Section 6 discusses the significance of ODDs in the context of the levels of driving automation.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 1 ACC driver support feature is designed to provide longitudinal vehicle motion control support to the
driver on fully access-controlled freeways under fair weather conditions.
EXAMPLE 2: An ADS feature is designed to operate a vehicle only on fully access-controlled freeways in low-speed traffic,
under fair weather conditions and optimal road maintenance conditions (e.g., good lane markings and not
under construction).
EXAMPLE 3: An ADS-dedicated vehicle is designed to operate only within a geographically defined military base, and only
during daylight at speeds not to exceed 25 mph.
EXAMPLE 4: An ADS-dedicated commercial truck is designed to pick up parts from a geo-fenced sea port and deliver them
via a specific route to a distribution center located 30 miles away. The vehicle’s ODD is limited to day- time
operation within the specified sea port and the specific roads that constitute the prescribed route between the
sea port and the distribution center.
EXAMPLE 5: A level 3 ADS highway feature with an ODD requirement of clearly visible lane lines encounters a short stretch
of roadway with obscured lane lines. The ADS feature is able to compensate for brief periods of faded or
missing lane markings through other means (e.g., sensor fusion, digital map, lead vehicle following) and
continues to operate the vehicle for a brief period before the lane lines again become clearly visible. A short
while later, the lane lines again become obscured and remain so for longer duration, causing the ADS feature
to issue a request to intervene to the fallback-ready user.
3.22 RECEPTIVITY [OF THE USER]
An aspect of consciousness characterized by a person’s ability to reliably and appropriately focus his/her attention in
response to a stimulus.
NOTE 1: In Level 0 to 2 driving automation, the driver is expected to be receptive to evident vehicle system failures, such
as a broken tie rod.
NOTE 2: In Level 3 driving automation, a DDT fallback-ready user is considered to be receptive to a request to intervene
and/or to an evident vehicle system failure, whether or not the ADS issues a request to intervene as a result of
such a vehicle system failure.
EXAMPLE 1: While a Level 3 ADS is performing the DDT in stop-and-go traffic, the left-front tire experiences a sudden
blow-out. The DDT fallback-ready user is receptive to the kinesthetic cue of the vehicle pulling significantly to
the left and intervenes in order to move the vehicle onto the road shoulder.
EXAMPLE 2: While a Level 3 ADS is performing the DDT on a free-flowing highway, the left side mirror glass falls out of
the housing. The DDT fallback-ready user, while receptive, does not and is not expected to notice this failure,
because it is not apparent, and does not adversely affect DDT performance by the ADS.
3.23 REMOTE ASSISTANCE
Event-driven provision, by a remotely located human (see 3.31.5), of information or advice to an ADS-equipped vehicle in
driverless operation in order to facilitate trip continuation when the ADS encounters a situation it cannot manage.
NOTE 1: Remote assistance does not include real-time DDT or fallback performance by a remote driver. Rather, the ADS
performs the complete DDT and/or fallback, even when assisted by a remotely located human.
NOTE 2: Remote assistance may include providing an ADS with revised goals and/or tasks.
NOTE 3: The remote assistance function does not include providing strategic instruction regarding selection of destinations
or trip initiation timing (i.e., dispatch functions), even if the same person performs both remote assistance and
dispatching functions.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 19 of 41
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 4 ADS-DV encounters an unannounced area of road construction within its ODD. The ADS-DV
communicates to a remotely located human that it is unable to proceed around the construction. The remotely
located human provides a new pathway for the vehicle to follow around the construction zone that allows the
ADS-DV to automatically proceed and complete its trip.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 4 ADS-DV detects an object in its lane that appears to be too large to drive over and stops. A remote
assistant uses the vehicle’s cameras to identify that the object is an empty bag that can be safely driven
through/over, and provides the instruction to the ADS-DV to proceed.
3.24 REMOTE DRIVING
Real-time performance of part or all of the DDT and/or DDT fallback (including, real-time braking, steering, acceleration,
and transmission shifting), by a remote driver.
NOTE 1: A receptive remote fallback-ready user becomes a remote driver when s/he performs the fallback.
NOTE 2: The remote driver performs or completes the OEDR and has the authority to overrule the ADS for purposes of
lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control.
NOTE 3: Remote driving is not driving automation.
NOTE 4: Remote driving of a vehicle by a human is sometimes referred to as “teleoperation.” However, “teleoperation” is
not defined consistently in the literature, and thus, to avoid confusion, is not used herein.
3.25 REQUEST TO INTERVENE
An alert provided by a Level 3 ADS to a fallback-ready user indicating that s/he should promptly perform the DDT fallback,
which may entail resuming manual operation of the vehicle (i.e., becoming a driver again), or achieving a minimal risk
condition if the vehicle is not operable.
NOTE: As previously noted in this document, it may be possible for a passenger in a Level 4 or 5 ADS-operated vehicle to
also resume manual operation of the vehicle under certain conditions, provided that the vehicle and feature are
designed for this (e.g., a dual-mode vehicle or a conventional vehicle with a Level 4 sub-trip feature). However,
even when alerted by the ADS to take over vehicle operation, a passenger of such a vehicle is not required to do
so to ensure competent operation, as Level 4 and 5 ADS features/vehicles are capable of automatically achieving
a minimal risk condition when necessary. Thus, such an alert to a passenger of a Level 4 or 5 ADS-operated vehicle
is not a “request to intervene” as defined herein for Level 3 ADS-equipped vehicles.
3.26 ROUTINE/NORMAL [ADS] OPERATION
Operation of a vehicle by an ADS within its prescribed ODD, if any, while no DDT performance-relevant system failure is
occurring.
NOTE: Routine/normal ADS operation includes vehicle responses to objects and events that are safety- and time-critical,
as well as vehicle responses to the same that are not safety- and time-critical.
3.27 SUPERVISE [DRIVING AUTOMATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE]
The driver activities, performed while operating a vehicle with an engaged Level 1 or 2 driver support feature, to monitor
that feature’s performance, respond to inappropriate actions taken by the feature, and to otherwise complete the DDT.
EXAMPLE: A driver notices that an engaged adaptive cruise control (ACC) feature is not maintaining headway to a
preceding vehicle in a curve and brakes accordingly.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 20 of 41
3.28 SUSTAINED [OPERATION OF A VEHICLE]
Performance of part or all of the DDT both between and across external events, including responding to external events
and continuing performance of part or all of the DDT in the absence of external events.
NOTE 1: External events are situations in the driving environment that necessitate a response by a driver or driving
automation system (e.g., other vehicles, lane markings, traffic signs).
NOTE 2: Sustained performance of part or all of the DDT by a driving automation system changes the user’s role. (See
scope for discussion of roles.) By contrast, an automated intervention that is not sustained according to this
definition does not qualify as driving automation. Hence, systems that provide momentary intervention in lateral
and/or longitudinal vehicle motion control but do not perform any part of the DDT on a sustained basis (e.g.,
anti-lock brake systems, electronic stability control, automatic emergency braking) are not classifiable (other than
at Level 0) under the taxonomy.
NOTE 3: Conventional cruise control does not provide sustained operation because it does not respond to external events.
It is therefore also not classifiable (other than at Level 0) under the taxonomy.
3.29 TRIP
The traversal of an entire travel pathway by a vehicle from the point of origin to a destination.
NOTE: Performance of the DDT during a given trip may be accomplished in whole or in part by a driver, driving automation
system, or both.
3.30 USAGE SPECIFICATION
A particular level of driving automation within a particular ODD.
NOTE: Each feature satisfies a usage specification.
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 2 feature provides lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion control support to the driver on fully
access-controlled freeways.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 3 feature operates the vehicle in high-volume traffic on designated fully access-controlled freeways.
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 4 ADS-DV operates at low speeds in designated urban centers.
3.31 [HUMAN] USER
A general term referencing the human role in driving automation.
NOTE 1: The following five terms (1 - driver, 2 - passenger, 3 - DDT fallback-ready user, 4 - driverless operation dispatcher,
and 5 - remote assistant) describe categories of (human) users.
NOTE 2: These human categories define roles that do not overlap and may be performed in varying sequences during a
given trip.
3.31.1 [HUMAN] DRIVER
A user who performs in real time part or all of the DDT and/or DDT fallback for a particular vehicle.
NOTE: This definition of “driver” does not include a robotic test device designed to exercise steering, braking, and
acceleration during certain dynamic test maneuvers.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 21 of 41
3.31.1.1 IN-VEHICLE DRIVER
A driver who manually exercises in-vehicle braking, accelerating, steering, and transmission gear selection input devices in
order to operate a vehicle.
NOTE 1: An in-vehicle driver is seated in what is normally referred to as “the driver’s seat” in automotive contexts, which
is a unique seating position that makes in-vehicle input devices (steering wheel, brake and accelerator pedals,
gear shift) accessible to a (human) driver.
NOTE 2: “Conventional driver” is an acceptable synonym for in-vehicle driver.
NOTE 3: In a conventional or dual-mode vehicle equipped with a driving automation system, an in-vehicle driver, who may
be a passenger or a fallback-ready user during ADS engagement, may assume or resume performance of part
or all of the DDT from the driving automation system during a given trip.
3.31.1.2 REMOTE DRIVER
A driver who is not seated in a position to manually exercise in-vehicle braking, accelerating, steering, and transmission
gear selection input devices (if any), but is able to operate the vehicle.
NOTE 1: A remote driver may include a user who is within the vehicle, within line-of-sight of the vehicle, or beyond
line-of-sight of the vehicle.
NOTE 2: A remote driver is not the same as a driverless operation dispatcher (see 3.32.4), although a driverless operation
dispatcher may become a remote driver if s/he has the means to operate the vehicle remotely.
NOTE 3: A remote driver does not include a person who merely creates driving-relevant conditions that are sensed by, or
communicated to, the ADS (e.g., a police officer who announces over a loudspeaker that a particular stop sign
should be ignored; another driver who flashes his/her head lamps to encourage overtaking, or a pedestrian using
a dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system to announce his/her presence).
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 2 automated parking feature allows the remote driver to exit the vehicle near an intended parking
space and to cause the vehicle to move into the parking space automatically by pressing and holding a special
button on the key fob, while s/he is monitoring the driving environment to ensure that no one and nothing
enters the vehicle pathway during the parking maneuver. If, during the maneuver, a dog enters the pathway
of the vehicle, the remote driver releases the button on the key fob in order to cause the vehicle to stop
automatically. (Note that the remote driver in this Level 2 example completes the OEDR subtask of the DDT
during the parking maneuver.)
EXAMPLE 2: Identical situation to Example 1, except that the remote driver is sitting in the back seat, rather than standing
outside the vehicle.
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 4 closed campus delivery vehicle that has experienced a DDT performance-relevant system failure,
which forced it to resort to a minimal risk condition by parking on the side of a campus roadway, is returned
to its designated marshalling yard by a remote driver who is able to operate the vehicle using wireless means.
3.31.2 PASSENGER
A user in a vehicle who has no role in the operation of that vehicle.
EXAMPLE 1: The person seated in the driver’s seat of a vehicle equipped with a Level 4 ADS feature designed to automate
high-speed vehicle operation on access-controlled freeways is a passenger while this Level 4 feature is
engaged. This same person, however, is a driver before engaging this Level 4 ADS feature and again after
disengaging the feature in order to exit the controlled access freeway.
EXAMPLE 2: The in-vehicle users of an ADS-DV shuttle on a university campus are passengers.
EXAMPLE 3: The in-vehicle users of a Level 5 ADS-equipped dual-mode vehicle are passengers whenever the Level 5
ADS is engaged.

3.31.3 [DDT] FALLBACK-READY USER
The user of a vehicle equipped with an engaged Level 3 ADS feature who is properly qualified and able to operate the
vehicle and is receptive to ADS-issued requests to intervene and to evident DDT performance-relevant system failures in
the vehicle compelling him or her to perform the DDT fallback.
NOTE 1: DDT performance by a Level 3 ADS assumes that a fallback-ready user is available to perform the DDT as
required. There is no such assumption at Levels 4 and 5.
NOTE 2: A DDT fallback-ready user who transitions to performing part or all of the DDT becomes a driver (in-vehicle or
remote).
3.31.3.1 IN-VEHICLE FALLBACK-READY USER
A fallback-ready user of a conventional vehicle with an engaged Level 3 ADS feature who is seated in the driver’s seat.
EXAMPLE: A Level 3 ADS sub-trip feature designed to perform the DDT in congested traffic on certain freeways encounters
emergency responders who are rerouting traffic to the exit due to a serious crash; the ADS issues a request to
intervene. The in-vehicle fallback-ready user becomes a driver and performs the fallback by manually operating
the vehicle.
3.31.3.2 REMOTE FALLBACK-READY USER
A fallback-ready user of a Level 3 ADS-equipped vehicle in driverless operation who is not in the driver’s seat.
EXAMPLE: A Level 3 ADS-DV encounters a crash scene for which emergency personnel are re-routing traffic; the ADS
issues a request to intervene. The remote fallback-ready user becomes a remote driver and performs the
fallback by remotely operating the vehicle.
3.31.4 DRIVERLESS OPERATION DISPATCHER
A user(s) who dispatches an ADS-equipped vehicle(s) in driverless operation.
NOTE: A dispacher(s) may also perform other fleet operations functions.
3.31.5 REMOTE ASSISTANT
A human(s) who provides remote assistance to an ADS-equipped vehicle in driverless operation.
NOTE: A remote assistant(s) may also perform other fleet operations functions.
3.32 [MOTOR] VEHICLE
A machine designed to provide conveyance on public streets, roads, and highways.
NOTE 1: As used in this document, [motor] vehicle refers to motorized vehicles and excludes those operated only on rail
lines. For reference, 49 U.S.C. § 30102(a)(6) defines [motor] vehicle as follows: “[motor] vehicle means a vehicle
driven or drawn by mechanical power and manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways,
but does not include a vehicle operated only on a rail line.”
NOTE 2: Types of [motor] vehicles discussed in this Recommended Practice include ADS-equipped vehicles,
ADS-dedicated vehicles, dual-mode vehicles, and conventional vehicles. ADS-dedicated vehicles and dual-mode
vehicles are always ADS-equipped vehicles. Conventional vehicles may or may not be ADS-equipped vehicles.

3.32.1 CONVENTIONAL VEHICLE
A vehicle designed to be operated by an in-vehicle driver during part or all of every trip.
NOTE 1: A conventional vehicle may be equipped with one or more Level 1 or 2 driving automation system features that
support the driver in performing the DDT, but do not perform the complete DDT. A conventional vehicle may also
be equipped with a Level 3 and/or Level 4 ADS sub-trip feature(s) that requires an in-vehicle driver to operate the
vehicle during portions of each trip (see 3.7.2).
NOTE 2: While it may be counterintuitive to call a vehicle equipped with an ADS “conventional,” it is appropriate in this
context because an in-vehicle driver is required for at least part of every trip. As emphasized below, this taxonomy
classifies the driving automation level of features rather than of vehicles (although, in the special case of an
ADS-DV, the classification of the ADS feature and the vehicle are effectively the same).
EXAMPLE 1: A vehicle with no driving automation system features that is designed to be operated by an in-vehicle driver
throughout all trips.
EXAMPLE 2: A vehicle equipped with Level 1 adaptive cruise control, Level 1 lane centering, and a Level 3 ADS feature
designed to perform the complete DDT during traffic jams on fully access-controlled freeways. The Level 3
ADS traffic jam feature requires the user to operate the vehicle on the way to the freeway before engaging
the feature, as well as again operating the vehicle upon exiting the freeway in order to complete the trip.
EXAMPLE 3: A vehicle equipped with a Level 4 valet parking feature designed to allow the user to exit the vehicle near a
parking lot and then dispatch it to a parking space.
3.32.2 [ADS-EQUIPPED] DUAL-MODE VEHICLE
An ADS-equipped vehicle designed to enable either driverless operation under routine/normal operating conditions within
its given ODD (if any), or operation by an in-vehicle driver, for complete trips.
NOTE 1: When operated by the ADS, dual-mode vehicles enable driverless operation, although a human driver could also
be present in the driver’s seat.
NOTE 2: An ADS sub-trip feature that is usable during only part of a trip, such as a feature designed to perform the complete
DDT during traffic jams on freeways, would not be sufficient to classify its host vehicle as a dual-mode vehicle
because it would not be capable of driverless operation for a complete trip.
NOTE 3: A vehicle equipped with a Level 5 feature in which at any time the driver can choose to engage the feature, or
can choose to operate the vehicle manually, would be classified as a dual-mode vehicle.
3.32.3 ADS-DEDICATED VEHICLE (ADS-DV)
An ADS-equipped vehicle designed for driverless operation under routine/normal operating conditions during all trips within
its given ODD (if any).
NOTE 1: In contrast to previous versions of this document, which specified that an ADS-DV was limited to Levels 4 and 5,
this revised definition of an ADS-DV also allows for the possibility of a Level 3 ADS-DV if the remote fallback-ready
user can be receptive to both ADS-issued requests to intervene and to evident DDT performance-relevant system
failures in the vehicle. Once either of these conditions occurs, the remote fallback-ready user begins to perform
the DDT fallback in (virtually) real time using wireless means. (See also 3.24 and 3.22.)
NOTE 2: An ADS-DV might be designed without user interfaces designed to be operable by an in-vehicle driver, such as
braking, accelerating, steering, and transmission gear selection input devices, or it might be designed so that
these devices are inoperative under routine/normal operating conditions.
NOTE 3: ADS-DVs might be operated temporarily by a human driver: (1) to manage transient deviations from the ODD,
(2) to address a system failure, or (3) while in a marshalling yard before or after being repaired/serviced or
dispatched.

EXAMPLE 1: A Level 4 ADS-DV designed to operate exclusively within a corporate campus where it picks up and
discharges passengers along a specific route specified by the ADS-DV dispatcher.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 4 ADS-DV designed to operate exclusively within a geographically prescribed central business district
where it delivers supplies using roads (but not necessarily routes) specified by the ADS-DV dispatcher.
EXAMPLE 3: A Level 5 ADS-DV capable of operating on all mapped roads in the US that are navigable by a human driver.
The user simply inputs a destination, and the ADS-DV automatically navigates to that destination.
4. TAXONOMY OF DRIVING AUTOMATION
The terms defined above inform a taxonomy of driving automation consisting of six discrete and mutually exclusive levels
(see 8.3 and 8.4). Central to this taxonomy are the respective roles of the (human) user and the driving automation system
in relation to each other. Because changes in the functionality of a driving automation system change the role of the (human)
user, they provide a basis for categorizing such system features. For example:
• If the driving automation system performs the sustained longitudinal and/or lateral vehicle motion control subtasks of
the DDT, the driver does not do so, although s/he is expected to complete the DDT. This division of roles corresponds
to Levels 1 and 2.
• If the driving automation system performs the entire DDT, the user does not do so. However, if a DDT fallback-ready
user is expected to take over the DDT when a DDT performance-relevant system failure occurs or when the driving
automation system is about to leave its operational design domain (ODD), then that user is expected to be receptive
and able to resume DDT performance when alerted to the need to do so. This division of roles corresponds to Level 3.
• Lastly, if a driving automation system can perform the entire DDT and DDT fallback either within a prescribed ODD
(Level 4) or in all driver-manageable on-road operating situations (Level 5) then any users present in the vehicle while
the ADS is engaged are passengers.
Although the vehicle fulfills a role in this driving automation taxonomy (see scope), it does not change the role of the user
in performing the DDT. By contrast the role played by the driving automation system complements the role of the user in
performing the DDT, and in that sense changes it.
In this way, driving automation systems are categorized into levels based on:
a. Whether the driving automation system performs either the longitudinal or the lateral vehicle motion control subtask of
the DDT.
b. Whether the driving automation system performs both the longitudinal and the lateral vehicle motion control subtasks
of the DDT simultaneously.
c. Whether the driving automation system also performs the OEDR subtask of the DDT.
d. Whether the driving automation system also performs DDT fallback.
e. Whether the driving automation system is limited by an ODD.
Table 1 summarizes the six levels of driving automation in terms of these five elements.
SAE’s levels of driving automation are descriptive and informative, rather than normative, and technical rather than legal.
Elements indicate minimum rather than maximum capabilities for each level. In this table, “system” refers to the driving
automation system or ADS, as appropriate.

Figure 10 - Simplified logic flow diagram for assigning driving automation level to a feature
Figure 10 shows a simplified logic diagram for classifying driving automation features. Note that the information required to
answer the questions posed in this figure cannot be empirically derived (see 8.2).
Table 2 details the six levels of driving automation with reference to the roles (if any) that the user and the driving automation
system play in performing the DDT and the DDT fallback. (NOTE: This assignment of roles refers to technical aspects of
vehicle operation rather than to legal aspects.)
The descriptions provided in column 2 of Table 2 indicate the role (if any) of the user in performing part or all of the DDT
and/or performing the DDT fallback, while the descriptions provided in column 3 indicate the role (if any) of the driving
automation system in performing the same. As in Table 1, “system” refers to the driving automation system or ADS, as
appropriate.
Note that the foregoing roles are determined by the design of the driving automation system in combination with the
instructions provided to the user, regardless of malfunction in a particular driving automation system or a user’s
mis-performance of his or her role in a given circumstance (see 8.2).

Table 3 describes a user’s role with respect to an engaged driving automation system operating at a particular level of
driving automation at a particular point in time. A user occupying a given vehicle can have one of three possible roles during
a particular trip: (1) driver, (2) in-vehicle fallback-ready user, or (3) passenger. A remote user of a given vehicle (i.e., who is
not seated in the driver’s seat of the vehicle during use) can also have one of three possible roles during a particular trip:
(1) remote driver, (2) remote fallback-ready user, or (3) driverless operation dispatcher.

NOTE: A vehicle equipped with a Level 4 or 5 ADS may also support a driver role. For example, in order to complete
a given trip, a user of a vehicle equipped with a Level 4 ADS feature designed to operate the vehicle during
high-speed freeway conditions will generally choose to perform the DDT when the freeway ends; otherwise
the ADS will automatically perform DDT fallback and achieve a minimal risk condition as needed. However,
unlike at Level 3, this user is not a DDT fallback-ready user while the ADS is engaged.
5. LEVELS OR CATEGORIES OF DRIVING AUTOMATION
As discussed above, the level of driving automation is based on the functionality of the driving automation system feature,
as determined by an allocation of roles in DDT and DDT fallback performance between that feature and the (human) user
(if any). The manufacturer of a driving automation system feature determines that feature’s requirements, operational design
domain (ODD), and operating characteristics, including the level of driving automation, as defined below. The manufacturer
also defines the proper use of that feature.
The lower two levels of driving automation (1 and 2) refer to cases in which the (human) driver continues to perform part of
the DDT while the driving automation system is engaged. These are therefore referred to as “driver support” features. (See
Table 2.)
The upper three levels of driving automation (3 to 5) refer to cases in which the automated driving system (ADS) performs
the entire DDT on a sustained basis while it is engaged. These are therefore referred to as “automated driving” features (or
the vehicles equipped with them). (See Table 2.)
5.1 Level or Category 0 - No Driving Automation
The performance by the driver of the entire DDT, even when enhanced by active safety systems.
5.2 Level or Category 1 - Driver Assistance
The sustained and ODD-specific execution by a driving automation system of either the lateral or the longitudinal vehicle
motion control subtask of the DDT (but not both simultaneously) with the expectation that the driver performs the remainder
of the DDT.
NOTE 1: A Level 1 driver support feature performing either the lateral or the longitudinal vehicle motion control subtask of
the DDT is capable of only limited OEDR within its dimension (lateral or longitudinal), meaning that there are
some events that the driving automation system is not capable of recognizing or responding to. Therefore, the
driver must supervise the driving automation system performance by completing the OEDR subtask of the DDT
as well as performing the other dimension of vehicle motion control. See Figure 2 (discussing the three primary
subtasks of the DDT).
NOTE 2: The term “driver assistance” as a modifier is also commonly used to describe automotive features that are not
considered to be driving automation system features, because they do not provide sustained performance of part
or all of the DDT.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 31 of 41
NOTE 3: The term “Advanced Driver Assistance Systems” (ADAS) is commonly used to describe a broad range of features,
including those that provide warnings and/or momentary intervention, such as forward collision warning (FCW)
systems, lane keeping assistance (LKA) systems, and automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems, as well as
some convenience features that involve Level 1 driver support features, such as ACC and certain parking
assistance features. As such, the term ADAS is too broad and imprecise for use in a technical definitions
document.
5.3 Level or Category 2 - Partial Driving Automation
The sustained and ODD-specific execution by a driving automation system of both the lateral and longitudinal vehicle motion
control subtasks of the DDT with the expectation that the driver completes the OEDR subtask and supervises the driving
automation system.
NOTE: A Level 2 driver support feature is capable of only limited OEDR, meaning that there are some events that it is not
capable of recognizing or responding to. Therefore, the driver supervises the feature’s performance by completing
the OEDR subtask of the DDT. See Figure 2 (discussing the three primary subtasks of the DDT).
5.4 Level or Category 3 - Conditional Driving Automation
The sustained and ODD-specific performance by an ADS of the entire DDT under routine/normal operation (see 3.27) with
the expectation that the DDT fallback-ready user is receptive to ADS-issued requests to intervene, as well as to DDT
performance-relevant system failures in other vehicle systems, and will respond appropriately.
NOTE 1: Unlike Level 1 and 2 driver support features, all Level 3 and 4 ADS features are designed to monitor and enforce
their ODD limitations while engaged, and to prevent engagement or operation outside of their prescribed ODD.
NOTE 2: The DDT fallback-ready user need not supervise a Level 3 ADS while it is engaged but is expected to be prepared
to either resume DDT performance when the ADS issues a request to intervene or to perform the fallback and
achieve a minimal risk condition if the failure condition precludes continued vehicle operation.
NOTE 3: A Level 3 ADS’s DDT fallback-ready user is also expected to be receptive to evident DDT performance-relevant
system failures in vehicle systems that do not necessarily trigger an ADS-issued request to intervene, such as a
broken body or suspension component.
NOTE 4: In the event of a DDT performance-relevant system failure in a Level 3 ADS, or in the event that the ADS exits its
ODD, the ADS will issue a request to intervene within sufficient time for the fallback-ready user (whether in-vehicle
or remote) to respond appropriately.
NOTE 5: An “appropriate” response by a DDT fallback-ready user to a request to intervene may entail either bringing the
vehicle to a minimal risk condition or continuing to operate the vehicle after the ADS has disengaged.
NOTE 6: Although automated DDT fallback performance is not expected of Level 3 ADS features, a Level 3 feature may
be capable of performing the DDT fallback and achieving a minimal risk condition under certain, limited conditions.
EXAMPLE: An ADS feature capable of performing the entire DDT in low-speed, stop-and-go freeway traffic.
5.5 Level or Category 4 - High Driving Automation
The sustained and ODD-specific performance by an ADS of the entire DDT and DDT fallback’.
NOTE 1: The user does not need to supervise a Level 4 ADS feature or be receptive to a request to intervene while the
ADS is engaged. A Level 4 ADS is capable of automatically performing DDT fallback, as well as achieving a
minimal risk condition if a user does not resume performance of the DDT. This automated DDT fallback and
minimal risk condition achievement capability is the primary difference between Level 4 and Level 3 ADS features.
This means that an in-vehicle user of an engaged Level 4 ADS feature is a passenger who need not respond to
DDT performance-relevant system failures.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 32 of 41
NOTE 2: Level 4 ADS features may be designed to operate the vehicle throughout complete trips (see 3.7.3), or they may
be designed to operate the vehicle during only part of a given trip (see 3.7.2), For example, in order to complete
a given trip, a user of a vehicle equipped with a Level 4 ADS feature designed to operate the vehicle during high-
speed freeway conditions will need to perform the DDT when the freeway ends in order to complete his or her
intended trip; the ADS, however, will automatically perform the DDT fallback and achieve a minimal risk condition
if the user fails to take over when the freeway ends (e.g., because s/he is sleeping). Unlike at Level 3, the Level 4
feature user is not a DDT fallback-ready user while the ADS is engaged (see Example 2 below), and thus is not
expected to respond to a request to intervene in order to perform the fallback. Nevertheless, in the case that a
Level 4 sub-trip feature reaches its ODD limit, the ADS may issue an alert to the passenger that s/he should
resume driving in order to complete their trip. (Note that in this latter case, the alert in question is not a request to
intervene, because it does not signal the need for fallback performance.)
EXAMPLE 1: A Level 4 ADS feature capable of performing the entire DDT during valet parking (i.e., curb-to-door or vice
versa) without any driver supervision.
EXAMPLE 2: A Level 4 ADS feature capable of performing the entire DDT during sustained operation on a motorway or
freeway (i.e., within its ODD). (Note: The presence of a user in the driver’s seat who is capable of performing
the DDT is envisioned in this example, as driver performance of the DDT would have been necessary before
entering, and would again be necessary after leaving, the motorway or freeway. Thus, such a feature would
alert the user that s/he should resume vehicle operation shortly before exiting the ODD, but if the user fails to
respond to such an alert, the ADS will nevertheless perform the DDT fallback and achieve a minimal risk
condition automatically.)
EXAMPLE 3: A driverless operation dispatcher may engage a Level 4 ADS-DV capable of following a pre-defined route
within a confined geographical area (e.g., residential community, military base, university campus).
5.6 Level or Category 5 - Full Driving Automation
The sustained and unconditional (i.e., not ODD-specific) performance by an ADS of the entire DDT and DDT fallback.
NOTE 1: “Unconditional/not ODD-specific” means that the ADS can operate the vehicle on-road anywhere within its region
of the world and under all road conditions in which a conventional vehicle can be reasonably operated by a
typically skilled human driver. This means, for example, that there are no design-based weather, time-of-day, or
geographical restrictions on where and when the ADS can operate the vehicle. However, there may be conditions
not manageable by a driver in which the ADS would also be unable to complete a given trip (e.g., white-out snow
storm, flooded roads, glare ice, etc.) until or unless the adverse conditions clear. At the onset of such
unmanageable conditions the ADS would perform the DDT fallback to achieve a minimal risk condition (e.g., by
pulling over to the side of the road and waiting for the conditions to change).
NOTE 2: In the event of a DDT performance-relevant system failure (of an ADS or the vehicle), a Level 5 ADS automatically
performs the DDT fallback and achieves a minimal risk condition.
NOTE 3: The user does not need to supervise a Level 5 ADS.
EXAMPLE: A vehicle with an ADS that, once programmed with a destination, is capable of operating the vehicle throughout
complete trips on public roadways, regardless of the starting and end points or intervening road, traffic, and
weather conditions.
6. SIGNIFICANCE OF OPERATIONAL DESIGN DOMAIN (ODD)
Conceptually, the role of a driving automation system vis-à-vis a user in performance of part or all of the DDT is orthogonal
to the specific conditions under which it performs that role. For example, a specific implementation of adaptive cruise control
may be intended to operate only at high speeds, only at low speeds, or at all speeds. For simplicity, however, this taxonomy
collapses these two axes into a single set of levels of driving automation. Levels 1 through 4 expressly contemplate ODD
limitations. In contrast, Level 5 (like Level 0) does not have ODD limitations (subject to the discussion in 8.8).
Accordingly, accurately describing a feature (other than at Levels 0 and 5) requires identifying both its level of driving
automation and its operational design domain (ODD). As provided in the definitions above, this combination of level of
driving automation and ODD is called a usage specification, and a given feature satisfies a given usage specification.

Downloaded from SAE International by SAE International [Sales Team], Tuesday, May 04, 2021
SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 33 of 41
Because of the wide range of possible ODDs, a wide range of possible features may exist at each level (e.g., Level 4
includes parking, high-speed, low-speed, geo-fenced, etc.). For this reason, this taxonomy provides less detail about the
ODD attributes that may define a given feature than about the respective roles of a driving automation system and its user.
ODD is especially important to understanding why a given ADS is not Level 5 merely because it operates an ADS-dedicated
vehicle. Unlike a Level 5 ADS, a Level 3 or 4 ADS has a limited ODD. Geographic, speed, environmental or other ODD
restrictions on an ADS-DV may reflect technological limitations of its ADS, or they may reflect vehicle design limitations.1
Level 1 to Level 4 features are subject to limited ODDs. These limitations generally reflect the technological capability of
the driving automation system. For example, Level 4 ADS-DVs that operate in enclosed courses have existed for many
decades as people movers and airport shuttles. The ODD for such vehicles is very simple, well-controlled, and physically
enclosed (vehicle operates on a fixed course; physical barriers prevent encroachment; protected from external events,
weather, etc.). This highly structured and simple ODD makes it technologically less challenging to achieve Level 4 driving
automation. However, a Level 3 ADS feature that operates a vehicle on open roads in mixed traffic, and does so in
environments that include inclement weather, faces a significantly higher technological bar in terms of ADS capability by
virtue of the more complex and unstructured ODD (see Figure 11).
Note also that the ODD for a given driving automation system feature potentially encompasses a broad set of parameters
that define the limits of that feature’s functional capability to operate in design-specified on-road environments. It includes
variables as widely ranging as specific road types, weather conditions, lighting conditions, geographical restrictions, and
the presence or absence of certain road features, such as lane markings, road side traffic barriers, median strips, etc. As
such, a given driving automation system feature has only one ODD, but that ODD may be quite varied and multi-faceted.
Even though the ODD is composed of multiple variables, it would be incorrect to say that a driving automation feature has
multiple ODDs. A feature will operate as designed (see 3.26) only when all the ODD-defining variables satisfy design criteria.
Figure 12 illustrates the orthogonality of ODD relative to levels of driving automation.
Figure 11 - ODD relative to driving automation levels
1 It should be noted that ODD determinations may also reflect business considerations unrelated to technological limitations, such as revenue
potential and risk management strategies, as determined by the manufacturer of the ADS and/or ADS-equipped vehicle.

For the sake of clarity, this section identifies certain deprecated terms that are not used in this document either because
they are functionally imprecise (and therefore misleading) and/or because they are frequently misused by application to
lower levels of driving automation (i.e., Levels 1 and 2) in which the driving automation system does not perform the entire
DDT.
7.1 Autonomous, Driving Modes(s), Self-Driving, Unmanned, Robotic
Vernacular terms such as those above are sometimes used—inconsistently and confusingly—to characterize driving
automation systems and/or vehicles equipped with them. Because automation is the use of electronic or mechanical devices
to replace human labor, based on the Oxford English Dictionary, automation (modified by “driving” to provide context) is the
appropriate term for systems that perform part or all of the DDT. The use of other terms can lead to confusion,
misunderstanding, and diminished credibility.
7.1.1 Autonomous
This term has been used for a long time in the robotics and artificial intelligence research communities to signify systems
that have the ability and authority to make decisions independently and self-sufficiently. Over time, this usage was casually
broadened to not only encompass decision making, but to represent the entire system functionality, thereby becoming
synonymous with automated. This usage obscures the question of whether a so-called “autonomous vehicle” depends on
communication and/or cooperation with outside entities for important functionality (such as data acquisition and collection).
Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and
self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered
cooperative rather than autonomous. Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving
automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined
it to correspond approximately to any ADS at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).
Additionally, in jurisprudence, autonomy refers to the capacity for self-governance. In this sense, also, “autonomous” is a
misnomer as applied to automated driving technology, because even the most advanced ADSs are not “self-governing.”
Rather, ADSs operate based on algorithms and otherwise obey the commands of users.
For these reasons, this document does not use the popular term “autonomous” to describe driving automation.

7.1.2 Driving Mode(s)
In the first version of this document, the term “driving mode” was used in place of “operational design domain (ODD).”
However, “driving mode” is an imprecise term and excludes many of the conditions that characterize an ODD. For these
reasons, we recommend against the use of “driving mode(s)” to describe the ODD of a given driving automation system
feature.
7.1.3 Self-Driving
The meaning of this term can vary based on unstated assumptions about the meaning of driving and driver. It is variously
used to refer to situations in which no driver is present, to situations in which no user is performing the DDT, and to situations
in which a driving automation system is performing any part of the DDT.
7.1.4 Unmanned
This term is frequently misused to describe any vehicle equipped with a Level 2 or higher driving automation system. The
term “unmanned” suggests the absence of a person in a vehicle, which can also be misleading because it does not
distinguish between a vehicle operated by a remote driver and an ADS-operated vehicle in which there are no occupants
that have the ability to operate the vehicle.
7.1.5 Robotic
This term is sometimes used to connote Level 4 or 5 driving automation, such as a closed-campus ADS-DV or a “robotic
taxi,” but it is technically vague because any automation technology could be considered to be “robotic,” and as such it
conveys no useful information about the ADS or vehicle in question.
7.2 Automated or Autonomous Vehicle
This document recommends against using terms that make vehicles, rather than driving, the object of automation, because
doing so tends to lead to confusion between vehicles that can be operated by a (human) driver or by an ADS and ADS-DVs,
which are designed to be operated exclusively by an ADS. It also fails to distinguish other forms of vehicular automation
that do not involve automating part or all of the DDT.
Moreover, a given vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system that is capable of delivering multiple driving
automation features that operate at different levels; thus, the level of driving automation exhibited in any given instance is
determined by the feature(s) engaged.
As such, the recommended usage for describing a vehicle with driving automation capability is “Level [1 or 2] driving
automation system-equipped vehicle” or “Level [3, 4, or 5] ADS-equipped vehicle.” The recommended usage for describing
a vehicle with an engaged system (versus one that is merely available) is “Level [1 or 2] driving automation system-engaged
vehicle” or “Level [3, 4, or 5] ADS-operated vehicle.”
7.3 Control
In colloquial discourse, the term “control” is sometimes used to describe the respective roles of a (human) driver or a driving
automation system (e.g., “the driver has control”). The authors of this document strongly discourage, and have therefore
deliberately avoided, this potentially problematic colloquial usage. Because the term “control” has numerous technical, legal,
and popular meanings, using it without careful qualification can confuse rather than clarify. In law, for example, “control,”
“actual physical control,” and “ability to control” can have distinct meanings that bear little relation to engineering control
loops. Similarly, the statement that the (human) driver “does not have control” may unintentionally and erroneously suggest
the loss of all human authority.
The preferred terms “DDT performance” (as explained in the definition of DDT above) and “operate” (also a defined term,
above) reduce potential confusion by specifically describing what the (human) driver or driving automation system actually
does in terms of performing part or all of the DDT. This document does use the terms lateral vehicle motion control and
longitudinal vehicle motion control, both of which are explicitly defined in terms of specific engineering functions.

If “control” is to be used in a particular driving automation context, it should be carefully qualified. To this end, the one using
the term “should first describe the control system they actually intend: the goals, inputs, processes, and outputs to the extent
they are determined by a human designer and the authority of the human or computer agents to the extent they are not.”

8. ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION
8.1 This document is not a specification and imposes no requirements.
This document provides a logical taxonomy for classifying driving automation features (and ADS-equipped vehicles), along
with a set of terms and definitions that support the taxonomy and otherwise standardize related concepts, terms and usage
in order to facilitate clear communications. As such, it is a convention based upon reasoned agreement, rather than a
technical specification.
By itself, this document imposes no requirements, nor confers or implies any judgment in terms of system performance.
Therefore, while it may be appropriate to state, for example, that a given ADS feature does not meet the definition of Level 4
because it occasionally relies on a remote fallback-ready user to perform the fallback (and is therefore a Level 3 feature), it
is not appropriate to conclude that the feature in question is therefore “non-compliant” or “unsafe.”
8.2 Levels are Assigned, Rather than Measured, and Reflect the Design Intent for the Driving Automation System Feature
as Defined by its Manufacturer
As a practical matter, it is not possible to describe or specify a complete test or set of tests which can be applied to a given
ADS feature to conclusively identify or verify its level of driving automation. The level assignment rather expresses the
design intention for the feature and as such tells potential users or other interested parties that the feature can be expected
to function such that the roles of the user versus the driving automation system while the feature is engaged are consistent
with the assigned level, as defined in this document. The level assignment is typically based on the manufacturer’s
knowledge of the feature’s/system’s design, development, and testing, which inform the level assignment. An ADS feature’s
capabilities and limitations are expected to be communicated to prospective users through various means, such as in an
owner’s manual, which explains the feature in more detail, such as how it should and should not be used, what limitations
exist (if any), and what to do (if anything) in the event of a DDT performance-relevant system failure in the driving automation
system or vehicle.
As such, the manifestation of one or more performance deficiencies in either the driving automation system or in the user’s
use of it does not automatically change the level assignment. For example:
• An ADS feature designed by its manufacturer to be Level 5 would not automatically be demoted to Level 4 simply by
virtue of encountering a particular road on which it is unable to operate the vehicle.
• The user of an engaged Level 3 ADS feature who is seated in the driver’s seat of an equipped vehicle is the DDT
fallback-ready user even if s/he is no longer receptive to a request to intervene because s/he has improperly fallen
asleep.
The level of a driving automation system feature corresponds to the feature’s production design intent. This applies
regardless of whether the vehicle on which it is equipped is a production vehicle already deployed in commerce, or a test
vehicle that has yet to be deployed. As such, it is incorrect to classify a Level 4 design-intended ADS feature equipped on
a test vehicle as Level 2 simply because on-road testing requires a test driver to supervise the feature while engaged, and
to intervene if necessary to maintain operation.
8.3 Level Assignments are Nominal, Rather than Ordinal, and are Never Fractional
While numbered sequentially 0 through 5, the levels of driving automation do not specify or imply hierarchy in terms of
relative merit, technology sophistication, or order of deployment. Thus, this taxonomy does not specify or imply that, for
example, Level 4 is “better” than Level 3 or Level 2.

SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 37 of 41
Also, while it is possible to have a relatively high-functioning ADS feature, such as a Level 3 feature that is capable of
automatically achieving a minimal risk condition in most, but not all, foreseeable conditions within its ODD, it would violate
the definitions to refer to such a feature as a “low-functioning” or “partial” Level 4 ADS feature. Similarly, it is incorrect to
describe driving automation features using fractional levels, such as 2.5 or 4.7. Qualified or fractional levels would render
the meaning of the levels ambiguous by removing the clarity otherwise provided by the strict apportionment of roles between
the user and the driving automation system in performance of the DDT and fallback for a given vehicle.
8.4 Levels are Mutually Exclusive
The levels in this taxonomy are intentionally discrete and mutually exclusive. As such, it is not logically possible for a given
feature to be assigned more than a single level. For example, a low-speed driving automation feature described by the
manufacturer as being capable of performing the complete DDT in dense traffic on fully access-controlled freeways cannot
be both Level 3 and Level 4, because either it is capable of automatically performing the DDT fallback and achieving a
minimal risk condition whenever needed, or it relies (at least sometimes) on the driver to respond to a request to intervene
and either perform the DDT or achieve a minimal risk condition on his or her own.
It is, however, quite possible for a driving automation system to deliver multiple features at different levels, depending on
the usage specification and/or user preferences. For example, a vehicle may be equipped with a driving automation system
capable of delivering, under varying conditions, a Level 1 ACC feature, a Level 2 highway driving assistance feature, a
Level 3 freeway traffic jam feature, and a Level 4 automated valet parking feature—in addition to allowing the user to operate
the vehicle at Level 0 with no driving automation features engaged. From the standpoint of the user, these various features
engage sequentially, rather than simultaneously, even if the driving automation system makes use of much of the same
underlying hardware and software technology to deliver all four driving automation features.
8.5 DDT Performance, Fallback Performance, and Minimal Risk Condition Achievement are Separate Functions
When discussing handling of a system failure or out-of-operational design domain (out-of-ODD) condition for a Level 3, 4,
or 5 ADS, this document distinguishes among the following three, separate functions: (i) DDT performance, (ii) DDT fallback
performance, and (iii) minimal risk condition achievement.
i. DDT performance occurs under routine/normal operating conditions for the ADS feature. That is, the feature performs
the complete DDT while functioning normally and within its ODD, if any.
ii. DDT fallback occurs when an ADS is unable to continue to perform the complete DDT (i.e., under routine/normal
operation). For Level 3 ADS features, a human fallback-ready user (in-vehicle or remote) is expected to respond to a
request to intervene or a kinesthetically apparent vehicle failure by either resuming DDT performance if the vehicle
remains operable, or by achieving a minimal risk condition if the vehicle is not operable. For a Level 4 or 5 ADS, the
feature or system performs the fallback by automatically achieving a minimal risk condition by, for example, pulling onto
the road shoulder, turning on hazard lamps, disabling the propulsion system, and summoning roadside assistance.
(Note: that some Level 3 features may be designed to automatically perform the fallback and achieve a minimal risk
condition in some circumstances, such as when an obstacle-free, adjacent shoulder is present, but not in others, such
as when no such road shoulder is available.) When the ADS performs the fallback, it maneuvers the vehicle into a
minimal risk condition, which concludes the fallback response. However, when a fallback-ready user performs the
fallback, s/he may simply continue operating the vehicle manually, rather than achieving a minimal risk condition, when
the vehicle is operable.
iii. Fallback performance and minimal risk condition achievement at Levels 4 and 5 require that the ADS is still functional
after occurrence of a DDT performance-relevant system failure or out-of-ODD condition. If the ADS is not functional, a
failure mitigation strategy may apply (see 3.11 and 8.6). The minimal risk condition depends on both the vehicle
condition and its operating environment at the time that fallback is triggered and could follow a degraded mode strategy
that considers the relative risks associated with continuing operation, pulling off the road, or stopping in place.
8.6 DDT Fallback versus Failure Mitigation Strategy
ADS-equipped vehicles may have an additional failure mitigation strategy designed to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop
wherever the vehicle happens to be. For example, if the in-vehicle fallback-ready user of a Level 3 sub-trip traffic jam feature
fails to respond to a request to intervene after traffic clears (an out-of-ODD condition), the vehicle may have a failure
mitigation strategy designed to bring the vehicle to a controlled stop in its present lane of travel and turn on the hazard
lamps. Figure 13 displays a sample use case sequence.

SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 38 of 41
Level 4 and Level 5 ADS-equipped vehicles may also have a failure mitigation strategy of stop-in-place under certain rare,
catastrophic failure conditions that render the ADS non-functional through, for example, loss of backup power after initial
power failure or incapacitation of the ADS’s computing capability, which render it incapable of performing the fallback and
achieving a minimal risk condition. Figure 14 displays a sample use case sequence.
Failure mitigation performed by the vehicle is different from minimal risk condition achievement and is not part of the fallback
function assigned to a Level 4 or 5 ADS, because it occurs after the ADS has disengaged or been incapacitated by a rare,
catastrophic event, and, as such, it is also not within the scope of this taxonomy.
Figure 13 - Use case sequence for a Level 3 feature showing ADS engaged,
occurrence of a failure or out-of-ODD condition, and the fallback-ready user performing the fallback,
or, if the fallback-ready user fails to do so, a failure mitigation strategy, such as stop-in-lane
(Note: Dashed lines represent failure mitigation strategy.)

a catastrophic event (e.g., complete power failure) and the system achieving a minimal risk condition
(Note: Dashed lines represent failure mitigation strategy.)
8.7 Level 5 “Full Driving Automation” is the Inverse Analog of Level 0 “No Driving Automation”
As specified herein, Level 5 is distinguished from Level 4 by the fact that it is not operationally limited to a specific operational
design domain and can rather operate on-road anywhere that a typically skilled human driver can reasonably operate a
conventional vehicle.

SAE INTERNATIONAL J3016™ APR2021 Page 39 of 41
For example, referring to Level 4 ADS-DVs designed for low-speed operation within a particular geo-fenced city center as
“full automation” or “fully automated” is incorrect and should be avoided. This distinction recognizes the fact that, for a user
who is unable to operate a conventional vehicle, only a Level 5 ADS-equipped vehicle would be capable of fulfilling all of
the same mobility needs that are otherwise fulfilled by a conventional vehicle for a user who is able to operate a vehicle.
8.8 Practical Considerations Regarding Level 5
There are technical and practical considerations that mitigate the literal meaning of the stipulation that a Level 5 ADS must
be capable of ‘operating the vehicle on-road anywhere that a typically skilled human driver can reasonably operate a
conventional vehicle,’ which might otherwise be impossible to achieve. For example, an ADS-equipped vehicle that is
capable of operating a vehicle on all roads throughout the US, but, for legal or business reasons, cannot operate the vehicle
across the borders in Canada or Mexico can still be considered Level 5, even if geo-fenced to operate only within the U.S.
The rationale for this exception is that such a geo-fenced limitation (i.e., U.S., only) would not be due to limitations on the
technological capability of the ADS, but rather to legal or business constraints, such as legal restrictions in Canada and
Mexico/Central America that prohibit Level 5 deployment, or the inability to make a business case for expansion to those
markets.
8.9 User Request to Perform the DDT when a Level 3, 4, or 5 ADS is Engaged
Vehicles equipped with an engaged Level 3 ADS feature are expected to relinquish the DDT upon request by a DDT
fallback-ready user. This expectation is a logical consequence of the DDT fallback-ready user’s need to be able to perform
the DDT fallback whenever required, including in cases when a DDT performance-relevant vehicle system failure has
occurred that the ADS may not be monitoring (such as a broken suspension component).
Some ADS-equipped vehicles may not be designed to allow for driver operation (i.e., ADS-dedicated vehicles). In these
types of vehicles, passengers may be able to demand a vehicle stop by, for example, pulling an emergency stop lever, and
in response, the ADS would either achieve a minimal risk condition (e.g., given availability of an adjacent shoulder), or
execute a stop-in-path maneuver.
However, other vehicles equipped with Level 4 or 5 ADS features may also be designed for driver operation (i.e., at any
lower level, including Level 0). A user may request to operate these vehicles while the ADS is engaged without having been
issued an alert by the ADS. In these cases, the ADS may delay relinquishing the DDT to ensure a smooth transition to the
driver’s performance of the DDT, or to prevent a hazardous condition.
For example:
• A vehicle being operated by a Level 4 ADS highway pilot feature that is negotiating a tight curve may not immediately
disengage upon the user’s request but may instead do so gradually as the user indicates through steering input that
s/he is fully re-engaged in the DDT.
• A Level 4 ADS feature designed to operate a vehicle in a high-speed convoy with small gaps between vehicles may
delay relinquishing performance of the DDT to a user upon his or her request to resume driving until after the ADS has
safely maneuvered the vehicle out of the convoy, since (human) drivers may not be capable of safely operating a vehicle
in a close-coupled convoy.
8.10 Possible Automation of Some Strategic Aspects of Driving
Strategic aspects of vehicle operation (decisions regarding whether, when, and where to go, as well as how to get there)
are excluded from the definition of DDT, because they are considered user-determined aspects of the broader driving task,
even when partially automated, such as through route navigation software. However, for certain advanced ADS features,
such as ADS-dedicated vehicles that are operated as a ride-hailing or delivery service fleet, timing, route planning and even
destination selection may also be automated in accordance with purposes defined by the user, namely, a driverless
operation dispatcher or a dispatching entity.

8.11 Driving versus DDT
Driving entails a variety of decisions and actions, which may or may not involve a vehicle being in motion, or even being in
an active lane of traffic. The overall act of driving can be divided into three types of driver effort: strategic, tactical, and
operational (Michon, 1985). Strategic effort involves trip planning, such as deciding whether, when and where to go, how to
travel, best routes to take, etc. Tactical effort involves maneuvering the vehicle in traffic during a trip, including deciding
whether and when to overtake another vehicle or change lanes, selecting an appropriate speed, checking mirrors, etc.
Operational effort involves split-second reactions that can be considered pre-cognitive or innate, such as making
micro-corrections to steering, braking and accelerating to maintain lane position in traffic or to avoid a sudden obstacle or
hazardous event in the vehicle’s pathway.
The definition of DDT provided above (3.10) includes tactical and operational effort but excludes strategic effort. It is that
portion of driving that specifically entails operating a vehicle in an active lane of traffic when the vehicle is either in motion
or imminently so. (It should be noted that these terms—strategic, tactical and operational—may have different meanings in
other contexts but are defined as above for the purposes of this document.) Indeed, this Recommended Practice defines
“operate” to include both operational and tactical efforts.
Object and event detection, recognition, classification, and response (aka, OEDR) form a continuum of activities often cited
in the driver workload literature. In the case of driving automation systems, OEDR also includes events associated with
system actions or outcomes, such as undiagnosed driving automation system errors or state changes.
8.12 Crash Avoidance Features Found on Some Conventional Vehicles Designed for Human Operation are Subsumed by
an ADS
Crash avoidance features, including intervention-type active safety systems, may be included in vehicles equipped with
driving automation systems at any level. For ADS-equipped vehicles (i.e., Levels 3 to 5) that perform the complete DDT,
crash avoidance capability is part of ADS functionality.
8.13 Placing this Document in the Broader Context of Driver Assistance, Driving Automation, and Active Safety Features
In the broadest view of driver assistance and driving automation, various features can be categorized according to three
overarching operational concepts (referred to as “Principles of Operation”) described in the technical paper, “The Principles
of Operation Framework: A Comprehensive Classification Concept for Automated Driving Functions.” Features that provide
status information (e.g., state of electric propulsion system charge, oil pressure, weather conditions, etc.), or that alert drivers
to actual or potential hazards (e.g., lane departure or blind spot warnings) fall under Principle of Operation A (status alerts
and warnings). Features that provide sustained automation of part or all of the DDT fall under Principle of Operation B
(Sustained driving automation). And features that provide momentary, intermittent vehicle motion control action (not
sustained—e.g., automatic emergency braking) fall under Principle of Operation C (crash avoidance intervention). A given
vehicle may be equipped with several features that operate according to different Principles of Operation.
This document provides a taxonomy for driving automation system features that fall under Principle of Operation B according
to the aforementioned categories. Driving automation system features perform part or all of the DDT on a sustained basis
and, as such, fundamentally alter or eliminate the role of the driver in operating the vehicle. Features that fall into Principles
of Operation A or C are not classifiable under the taxonomy described in this document, either because they do not directly
affect vehicle motion control (A), or because they do not provide sustained performance of part or all of the DDT (C). It
should be noted, however, that an individual feature may incorporate the functionality according to more than one Principle
of Operation, such as a crash avoidance feature (C) that provides a warning to the driver (A) when it is engaged. Similarly,
the crash avoidance capabilities otherwise provided by features that fall under Principle of Operation C on vehicles operated
by human drivers are nevertheless performed as part of the sustained driving automation (B) provided by ADS-operated
vehicles. For example, automatic emergency braking (AEB), which automatically brakes the vehicle to avoid a collision with
a vehicle/object in its forward path, is not a standalone feature on an ADS-DV. However, emergency braking in response to
the actions of other road users and to objects and events in traffic is included in the ADS’s overall driving automation
capabilities.

8.14 Comparison of SAE J3016 Driving Automation Levels with BASt Levels
Prior to the initial publication of SAE J3016 in January 2014, the German Federal Highway Research Institute
(Bundesanstalt für Strassenwesen, a.k.a. BASt) published “Legal consequences of an increase in vehicle automation”
(Gasser, T.M., et al., July 23, 2013). After thorough review of this document, including discussions with the authoring
organization, SAE Task Force members were persuaded that the BASt levels were in line with the Task Force’s operating
principles, namely, that SAE J3016 should be:
• Descriptive rather than normative, which is to say it should provide functional definitions.
• Consistent with current industry practice.
• Consistent with prior art—we should start with what has already been done and change only what is necessary.
• Useful across disciplines, including engineering, law, media, public discourse.
• Clear and cogent, which is to say we should avoid or define ambiguous terms.
In keeping with these guiding principles, SAE largely adopted the BASt levels, but with several adjustments:
• Added a sixth level (namely, Level 5 - full driving automation) not described in the BASt levels.
• Modified level names accordingly.
• Added supporting terms and definitions, such as DDT, minimal risk condition, etc.
• Described categorical distinctions that provide for a step-wise progression through the levels.
• Provided explanatory text and examples to aid the reader in understanding the levels, definitions, and their derivation.
After SAE J3016 was published in January 2014, the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
(Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d’Automobiles, a.k.a., OICA) adopted the BASt levels and aligned them (in
English) with SAE J3016, including adding a sixth level to represent “full driving automation.”
