INTRODUCTION
The Government of India felt the need for a permanent agency to expedite the
publication of standards and development of test facilities in parallel when the
work on the preparation of the standards is going on, as the development of
improved safety critical parts can be undertaken only after the publication of the
standard and commissioning of test facilities. To this end, the Ministry of Surface
Transport (MOST) vide order No. RT-11028/11/97-MVL dated September
15,1997.The standard prepared by AISC will be approved by the permanent
CMVR Technical Standing Committee (CTSC). After approval, the Automotive

A2.1.3 The headlamps shall be checked by means of a standard (reference
or etalon) filament lamp designed for a rated voltage of 12V(1).
During the checking of the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals
of the filament lamp shall be regulated so as to obtain the reference
luminous flux as indicated at the relevant data sheet of AIS-034.
A2.1.4 The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the
requirements of this Annex:A2 with at least one standard
(reference or etalon) filament lamp, which may be submitted with
the headlamp.
A2.2 PROVISION CONCERNING DIPPED-BEAM
A2.2.1 The dipped-beam must produce a sufficiently sharp "cut-off" to
permit a satisfactory adjustment with its aid. The "cut-off" must be
a horizontal straight line on the side opposite to the direction of the
traffic for which the headlamp is intended; on the other side it must
not extend beyond either the broken line HV H1 H4 formed by a
straight line HV H1 making a 45° angle with the horizontal and the
straight line H1 H4, 25 cm above the straight line hh, or the straight
line HV H3, inclined at an angle of 15° above the horizontal (see
Figure A1). A "cut-off" extending beyond both line HV H2 and
line H2H4 and resulting from a combination of the two above
possibilities shall in no circumstances be permitted.
A2.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that:
A2.2.2.1 In the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left-
hand traffic, the “Cut-off” on the right half of the screen(2) is
horizontal;
A2.2.2.2 This horizontal part of the "cut-off" is situated on the screen 25 cm
below the level hh (See Figure A1);
(1) 24V rated voltage lamps also can be approved to this standard
(2) The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the cut-off
over a range of at least 50 on either side of the Line vv.

AIS-012
(1)
A2.2.2.3 The "elbow" of the "cut-off" is on line vv
A2.2.3 When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely
for provision of a dipped-beam(2), comply only with the
requirements set out in paragraphs A2.2.5 to A2.2.7 below; if it is
intended to provide both a dipped-beam and a main-beam, it shall
comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs from A2.2.5 to
A2.2.7 and A 2.3.
A2.2.4 Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out
in paragraphs A2.2.5 to A2.2.7 and A 2.3, its alignment may be
changed, provided that the axis of the beam is not displaced
laterally by more than 10 (= 44 cm) to the right or left (3). To
facilitate alignment by means of the "cut-off", the headlamp may
be partially occulted in order to sharpen the "cut-off".
A2.2.5 The illumination produced on the screen by the dipped-beam shall
meet the following requirements:

(*) E is the actually measured value in points 50R respectively 50 L
** The required illumination at these points is not applicable to lamps of
R2 & HS1 category.
A2.2.6 There shall be no lateral variations detrimental to good visibility in
any of the zones I, II, III, and IV.
(1) If the beam does not have a cut-off with a clear elbow the lateral adjustment
shall be effected in the manner which best satisfies the requirements for
illumination at points 75L & 50L for left hand traffic.
(2) Such a special “ dipped-beam” headlamp may incorporate a main-beam not
subject to requirements.
(3) The limit of realignment of 10 towards the right or left is not incompatible
with upward or down ward vertical realignment. The latter is limited only
by the requirements of paragraph A2.3 However, the horizontal part of the
“cut-off” should not extend beyond the line hh (the provisions of paragraph
A2.3 are not applicable to headlamps intended to meet the requirements of
relevant Annexes only for provision of a dipped-beam).
15/205
AIS-012
A2.2.7 The illumination values (1) in zones "A" and "B" as shown in
Figure A2 shall be checked by the measurement of the photometric
values of points 1 to 8 on this Figure; these values shall lie within
the following limits:(1)
1+2+3 (cid:149) 0.3 lux, and
4+5+6 (cid:149) 0.6 lux, and
0.7 lux (cid:149) 7 (cid:149) 0.1 lux and
0.7 lux (cid:149) 8 (cid:149) 0.2 lux
A2.3 PROVISIONS CONCERNING MAIN-BEAM
A2.3.1 In case of a headlamp designed to provide a main-beam and a
dipped-beam, measurements of the illumination produced on the
screen by the main-beam shall be taken with the same headlamp
alignment as for measurements under paragraphs A2.2.5 to A2.2.7
above; in the case of a headlamp providing a main-beam only, it
shall be so adjusted that the area of maximum illumination is
centered on the point of intersection of the lines hh and vv; such a
headlamp need meet only the requirements referred to in paragraph
A2.3. Where more than one light source is used to provide the
main-beam, the combined functions shall be used to determine the
maximum value of the illumination (E )
M
A2.3.2 The illumination produced on the screen by the main-beam shall
meet the following requirements:
A2.3.2.1 The point of intersection (HV) of the lines hh and vv shall be
situated within the isolux representing 80% of maximum
illumination. This maximum value (E ) shall be not less than
M
32 lux for Class A headlamps and 48 lux for Class B headlamps.
The maximum value shall in no case exceed 240 lux; moreover, in
the case of a combined passing and driving headlamp, this
maximum value shall not be more than 16 times the illumination
measured for the dipped-beam at point 75L.
A2.3.2.1.1 The maximum luminous intensity (I ) of the main-beam expressed
M
in thousands of candelas shall be calculated by means of the
formula:
I = 0.625 E
M M
A2.3.2.1.2 The reference mark (I’ ) indicating this maximum intensity shall

be obtained by means of the formula:
I’ = I / 3 = 0.208 E
M M M
(1) Illumination values in any point of Zones A & B, which also lies with Zone
III, shall not exceed 0.7 lux
16/205
AIS-012
This value shall be rounded to whichever is the nearest of the
following: 7.5-10-12.5-17.5-20-25-27.5-30-37.5-40-45-50.
A2.3.2.2. Starting from point HV, horizontally to the right and left the
illumination shall be not less than 16 lux for Class A headlamp and
24 lux for Class B headlamp up to a distance of 1.125 m and not
less than 4 lux for Class A headlamp and 6 lux for Class B
headlamp up to a distance of 2.25 m.
A2.4. In the case of headlamps with an adjustable reflector, the
requirements of paragraphs A2.2 and A2.3 are applicable for each
mounting position indicated in relevant para. of Table : 2. For
verification, the following procedure shall be used:
A2.4.1 Each applied position is realized on the test goniometer with
respect to a line joining the center of the light source and point HV
on the aiming screen. The adjustable reflector is then moved into
such a position that the light pattern on the screen corresponds to
the aiming prescriptions of paragraphs A2.2.1 to A2.2.2.3 and/or
A2.3.1;
A2.4.2. With the reflector initially fixed according to paragraph A2.4.1, the
headlamp must meet the relevant photometric requirements of
paragraphs A2.2 and A2.3;
A2.4.3 Additional tests are made after the reflector has been moved
vertically ± 2 degrees or at least into the maximum position, if less
than 2 degrees, from its initial position by means of the headlamps
adjusting device. Having re-aimed the headlamp as a whole (by
means of the goniometer for example) in the corresponding
opposite direction, the light output in the following directions shall
be controlled and lie within the required limits:
Dipped-beam: Points HV and 75L respectively;
Main-beam: E and Point HV (percentage of E )
M M
A2.4.4 If the applicant has indicated more than one mounting position, the
procedure of paragraphs A2.4.1 to A2.4.3 shall be repeated for all
the other positions;
A2.4.5 If the applicant has not asked for special mounting positions, the
headlamp shall be aimed for measurements of paragraphs A2.2 and
A2.3 with the headlamps adjusting device in its mean position. The
additional tests of paragraph A2.4.3 shall be made with the
reflector moved into its extreme positions (instead of ± 2°) by
means of the headlamps adjusting device.

PHOTOMETRIC TEST PROCEDURE AND
ILLUMINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR HEADLAMP
EQUIPED WITH GAS-DISCHARGE LIGHT SOURCES
B2.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
B2.1.1 Headlamps shall be so made that with suitable gas-discharge light
source they give adequate illuminance without dazzle when
emitting the dipped-beam, and good illumination when emitting the
main-beam.
B2.1.2 The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by
means of a vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and
at right angles to its axes (see paragraph B2.2.6. and Figure B1 and
B2), or by any equivalent photometric method.
B2.1.3 The headlamp using a removable gas-discharge light source shall
be deemed satisfactory if the photometric requirements set in the
present Annex : B2 are met with one standard light source, which
has been aged during at least 15 cycles, in accordance with
paragraph 9.2.1.2 of AIS-034. The flux of this gas-discharge light
source may differ from the objective luminous flux specified in
AIS 034. In this case, the illuminances shall be corrected
accordingly.
This correction does not apply to headlamps using non-removable
gas-discharge light source, or to headlamps with the ballast(s)
totally or partially integrated.
B2.1.4 The dimensions determining the position of the arc inside the
standard gas-discharge light source are shown in the relevant data
sheet of standard AIS 034.
B2.1.5 Photometric compliance must be checked in accordance with
paragraph B2.2.6 or B2.3 of this Annex. This is also valid for the
cut-off zone between 30 R and 30L (measurement method for the
cut-off colour being under consideration).
B2.1.6 Four seconds after ignition of a headlamp which has not been
operated for 30 minutes or more, 60 lux at least must be reached at
point HV of a main-beam and 10 lux at point 50V of a dipped-
beam for headlamps incorporating main-beam and dipped-beam
functions, or 10 lux at point 50V for headlamps having only a
dipped-beam function. The power supply shall be sufficient to
secure the quick rise of the high current pulse.
53/205
AIS-012
B2.2. PROVISIONS CONCERNING DIPPED-BEAM
B2.2.1 The dipped-beam must produce a sufficiently sharp "cut-off" to
permit a satisfactory adjustment with its aid. The "cut-off" must be
a horizontal straight line on the side opposite to the direction of
traffic for which the headlamp is intended;
on the other side it must not extend either above the line HV/H2 of
Figure B1, or above the line HV/H3/H4 of Figure B2. A cut-off
extending above a combination of these lines shall in no
circumstances be permitted.
B2.2.2 The headlamp shall be so aimed that:
B2.2.2.1 In the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of left-
hand traffic, the "cut-off" on the right-half of the screen is
horizontal(1)
B2.2.2.2 This horizontal part of the "cut-off" is situated on the screen 25 cm
below the line HH. (See Figure B1, B2) The kink of the elbow of
the cut-off shall be on the VV line.
B2.2.3 When so aimed, the headlamp needs, if its approval is sought
solely for a dipped-beam, comply only with the requirements
referred to in paragraphs B2.2.5 and B2.2.6 below; if it is intended
to provide both a dipped-beam and a main-beam, it shall comply
with the requirements set out in paragraphs B2.2.5 to B2.3.2.3. The
values specified for segment II in paragraph B2.2.6 do not apply to
Figure B2.
B2.2.4 Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out
in paragraphs B2.2.6 and B2.3., its alignment may be changed,
provided that the axis of the beam is not displaced laterally by
more than 0.5° (=22 cm) (2) to the right or left and vertically not
more than 0.2° (=8.7 cm) up or down To facilitate alignment by
.
means of the "cut-off", the headlamp may be partially occulted in
order to sharpen the "cut-off".
B2.2.5 Only one gas-discharge light source is permitted for each dipped-
beam headlamp.
B2.2.5.1 The voltage applied to the terminals of the ballast(s) is:
either: 13.5 V +/- 0.1 for 12 V systems
or: otherwise specified (See Annex : B9)
(1) The test screen must be sufficiently wide to allow examination of the "cut-
off" over a range of at least 5° each side of the line VV.
(2) The limit of realignment of 0.5° towards the right or left is not
incompatible with upward or downward vertical realignment. The latter is
limited, too, by the requirements of para. B2.3. However, the provisions
of paragraph B2.3 are not applicable to headlamps intended to meet the
requirements of this Annex only for provision of dipped-beam
54/205
AIS-012
B2.2.6 After more than 10 minutes after ignition the illuminances
produced on Screen of Figure B1 or B2 shall meet the following
requirements:
Note: In the table:
Letter L means that the point or segment is located on the left of VV line.
Letter R means that the point or segment is located on the right of VV line.

B2.3 PROVISIONS CONCERNING MAIN-BEAM
B2.3.1 In the case of a headlamp designed to provide a main-beam and a
dipped-beam, measurements of the illumination produced on the
screen by the main-beam shall be taken with the same headlamp
alignment as for measurements under paragraph B2.2.6 above; in
the case of a headlamp providing a main-beam only, it shall be so
adjusted that the area of maximum illumination is centered on the
point of intersection of lines HH and VV; such a headlamp needs
meet only the requirements referred to in paragraph B2.3. Test
voltages are the same as in paragraph B2.2.5.1
B2.3.2 It is possible to use several light sources for the main-beam, these
light sources being listed in AIS 034. The following provisions
shall be met:
B2.3.2.1 The point of intersection (HV) of the lines HH and VV shall be
situated within the isolux representing 80 % of the maximum
illuminance. This maximum illuminance, hereunder designated as
Emax, shall lie between 70 and 180 lux.
B2.3.2.2 The reference mark shall be obtained by means of the formula:
Reference mark = 0.208 Emax (See para 12.0)
This value shall be rounded off to the value: 17.5 - 20 - 25 - 27.5 -
30 - 37.5
B2.3.2.3 Starting from point HV, horizontally to the right and left, the
illuminance shall be not less than 40 lux up to a distance of 1.125m
and not less than 10 lux up to a distance of 2.25 m.
B2.4 The screen illuminance values mentioned in paragraphs B2.2.6 to
B2.3.2.3 above shall be measured by means of a photo-receptor,
the effective area of which shall be contained within a square of 65
mm side.
B2.5 PROVISIONS CONCERNING MOVABLE REFLECTORS
B2.5.1 With the lamp fixed according to all the positions described in
relevant paragraph of Table:2 of this standard, the headlamp must
meet the photometric requirements of paragraph B2.2 or B2.3, or
both.
B2.5.2 Additional tests are made after the reflector has been tilted
vertically upwards by the angle quoted in relevant paragraph of
Table:2 of this standard or 2° ; whichever is smaller, by means of
the headlamp aiming devices. The headlamp is then re-aimed
downwards (by means of the goniometer), and the photometric
specifications must be met at the following points:
56/205
AIS-012
Dipped-beam: HV and 75 L respectively
Main-beam: E max, HV as % of Emax
If the aiming devices do not allow a continuous movement, the
position nearest to 2° is chosen.
B2.5.3 The reflector is brought back to its nominal angular position as
defined in paragraph B2.2.2, and the goniometer is set back to its
position of origin. The reflector is tilted vertically downwards by
the angle quoted in relevant paragraph of Table:2 of this standard
or 2°, whichever is smaller, by means of the headlamp aiming
device. The headlamp is then re-aimed upwards (by means of the

TEST FOR STABILITY OF PHOTOMETRIC
PERFORMANCE OF FRONT FOG LAMP IN OPERATION
TESTS ON COMPLETE FRONT FOG LAMPS
Once the photometric values have been measured according to the
prescriptions of this Standard in the point of maximum illumination
in zone D (Emax) and in point HV, a complete front fog lamp
sample shall be tested for stability of photometric performance in
operation. "Complete front fog lamp" shall be understood to mean
the complete lamp itself including those surrounding body parts
and lamps, which could influence its thermal dissipation.
C4.1. TEST FOR STABILITY OF PHOTOMETRIC
PERFORMANCE
The tests shall be carried out in a dry and still atmosphere at an
ambient temperature of 230 C ± 50 C, the complete front fog lamp
being mounted on a base representing the correct installation on the
vehicle.
C4.1.1. Clean Front Fog Lamp
The front fog lamp shall be operated for 12 hours as described in
subparagraph C4.1.1.1. and checked as prescribed in subparagraph
C4.1.1.2.
C4.1.1.1 Test procedure
The front fog lamp shall be operated for the specified time so
that(1)
:
C4.1.1.1.1. (a) In the case where only a front fog lamp is to be approved, the
corresponding filament lamp(s) is (are) lit for the prescribed time;
(b) I n the case of a front fog lamp reciprocally incorporated with
another function: If the applicant declares that the front fog
lamp is to be used with a single filament lit(1) at a time, the test
shall be carried out in accordance with this condition, activating
each specified function successively for half the time specified
in paragraph C4.1.1.;
(1) Should two or more filaments be simultaneously lit when headlamp flashing
is used, this shall not be considered as being normal use of the filaments
simultaneously.
When the tested headlamp is grouped and/or reciprocally incorporated with
signaling lamps, the latter shall be lit for the duration of the test. In the case
of a direction indicator lamp, it shall be lit in flashing operation mode with
an on/off time ratio of approximately one to one
85/205
AIS-012
In all other cases, (1)the front fog lamp shall be subjected to the
following cycle until the time specified is reached:
15 minutes, front fog lamp filament(s) lit,
5 minutes, all filaments (that can be lit simultaneously);
(c) In the case of grouped lighting functions all the individual
functions shall be lit simultaneously for the time specified for
individual lighting functions (a), also taking into account the
use of reciprocally incorporated lighting functions, according to
the manufacturer's specifications.
C4.1.1.1.2. Test voltage
The voltage of the filament lamp shall be adjusted so as to supply
90 % of the maximum wattage specified in AIS-034 for filament
lamps. The applied wattage shall in all cases comply with the
corresponding value of a filament lamp of 12 V rated voltage,
except if the applicant for approval specifies that the front fog
lamp may be used at a different voltage. In the latter case, the test
shall be carried out with the filament lamp of which the wattage is
the highest that can be used.
C4.1.1.2. Test Results
C4.1.1.2.1. Visual inspection
Once the front fog lamp has been stabilized to the ambient
temperature, the front fog lamp lens and the external lens, if any,
shall be cleaned with a clean, damp cotton cloth. It shall then be
inspected visually; no distortion, deformation, cracking or change
in color of either the front fog lamp lens or the external lens, if any,
shall be noticeable.
C4.1.1.2.2. Photometric test
To comply with the requirements of this standard, the following
photometric values shall be verified in the following points: HV,
and point of Emax in zone D.
Another aiming may be carried out to allow for any deformation of
the front fog lamp base due to heat (the change of the position of
the cut-off line is covered in paragraph C4.2).
(1) Should two or more filaments be simultaneously lit when headlamp flashing
is used, this shall not be considered as being normal use of the filaments
simultaneously.
When the tested headlamp is grouped and/or reciprocally incorporated with
signaling lamps, the latter shall be lit for the duration of the test. In the case
of a direction indicator lamp, it shall be lit in flashing operation mode with
an on/off time ratio of approximately one to one

they may be subjected in such use, their satisfactory operation
remains assured and they retain the characteristics prescribed by
this standard.
D1.1.3 Lamps having been approved as front or rear position (side) lamps,
are deemed being also approved end-outline marker lamps.
D1.1.4 Front and rear position (side) lamps which are grouped or
combined or reciprocally incorporated may also be used as end-
outline marker lamps.

D2.1.2. Outside the reference axis and within the angular fields defined in
the diagrams Annex : D2 – Appendix 1, the intensity of the light
emitted by each of the two devices supplied shall:
D2.1.2.1. In each direction corresponding to the points in the light
distribution table reproduced in Annex : D2 – Appendix 2 (Table :
D1 ,D2), be not less than the product of the minimum specified in
paragraph D2.1. above by the percentage specified in the said table
of the direction in question. ( Tables : D3, D4 give required
intensity values)
D2.1.2.2. In no direction within the space from which the light-signalling
device is visible, exceed the maximum specified in paragraph D2.1.
above;
D2.1.2.3. However, a luminous intensity of 60 cd shall be permitted for rear
position (side) lamps reciprocally incorporated with stop-lamps
(see paragraph D2.1.1.3. above) below a plane forming an angle of
5° with and downward from the horizontal plane;
D2.1.2.4. Moreover,
D2.1.2.4.1. Throughout the fields defined in the diagrams in
Annex D2 – Appendix 1, the intensity of the light emitted shall be
not less than 0.05 cd for front and rear position (side) lamps and
end outline marker lamps, not less than 0.3 cd for stop-lamps with
one level of intensity, and for stop-lamps with two levels of
intensity 0.3 cd by day and 0.07 cd by night;
(1) The installation of the devices referred to above in power-driven vehicles and their trailers is
provided for in the standard concerning the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices
(AIS-008).
(2) The total value of maximum intensity for an assembly of two or more lamps is given by
multiplying by 1.4 the value prescribed for a single lamp. When an assembly of two or more
lamps having the same function is deemed to be, for the purpose of installation on a vehicle, a
''single lamp'' (following the definition of AIS-008 and its amendments in force at the time of
application for type approval), this assembly shall comply with the minimum intensity
required when one lamp has failed, and all the lamps together shall not exceed the admissible
maximum intensity (last column of the table).
In the case of a single lamp containing more than one light source:
(i) all light sources which are connected in series are considered to be one light source;
(ii) the lamp shall comply with the minimum intensity required when any one light source
has failed. However, for lamps designed for only two light sources, 50 per cent of the
minimum intensity in the axis of reference of the lamp shall be considered sufficient,
provided that a note in the technical information to be submitted by manufacturer
shall states that the lamp is only for use on a vehicle fitted with an operating tell-tale
which indicates when any one of these two light sources has failed.
(iii) when all light sources are illuminated the maximum intensity specified for a single lamp
may be exceeded provided that the single lamp is not marked ''D'' and the maximum
intensity specified for an assembly of two or more lamps (last column of the table) is not
exceeded.
(3) Devices which may be used as part of an assembly of two lamps
105/205
AIS-012
D2.1.2.4.2. If a rear position (side) lamp is reciprocally incorporated with a
stop-lamp, the ratio between the luminous intensities actually
measured of the two lamps when turned on simultaneously at the
intensity of the rear position (side) lamp when turned on alone
should be at least 5 : 1 in the field delimited by the straight
horizontal lines passing through + 50 V and the straight vertical
lines passing through + 100 H of the light distribution table. If the
stop-lamp has two levels of intensity, this requirement must be
satisfied when the night condition is switched on; If the rear
position (side) lamp or the stop lamp or both contain more than one
light source and are considered as a single lamp as defined in
note (2) of the table in paragraph D2.1.1 above, the values to be
considered are those obtained with all sources in operation;
D2.1.2.4.3. The provisions of paragraph D2:APP.2.2.2 of Annex : D2 –
Appendix 2 on local variations of intensity must be observed.
D2.1.3. The intensities shall be measured with the filament lamp(s)
continuously alight and, in the case of devices emitting selective-
yellow or red light, in coloured light.
D2.1.4. In the case of a stop-lamp providing two levels of intensity, the
time that elapses between electrical supply being switched on and
the light output measured on the reference axis to reach 90% of the
value measured in accordance with paragraph D2.1.3 above shall
be measured for both the day and the night conditions of use. The
time measured for the night condition of use shall not exceed that
measured for the day condition of use.
D2.1.5 Annex : D2 – Appendix 2 to which reference is made in paragraph
D2.1.2.1. above, gives particulars of the methods of measurement
to be used.
D2.2 TEST PROCEDURE
D2.2.1. All measurements, photometric and colorimetric, shall be made
with a colourless standard filament lamp of the category prescribed
for the device, the supply voltage being so regulated as to produce
the reference luminous flux required for that category of lamp.
D2.2.1.1 In the case of a system with more than one intensity, the reference
luminous flux prescribed for the specific category of filament lamp
shall be applied to the greatest intensity.
D2.2.1.2. All measurements, photometric and colorimetric, on lamps
equipped with non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and
others) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V, respectively.
106/205
AIS-012
D2.2.1.3. In the case of light sources supplied by a special power supply, the
above test voltages shall be applied to the input terminals of that
power supply. The test laboratory may require from the
manufacturer the special power supply needed to supply the light
sources.
D2.2.2. However, in the case of a stop-lamp for which an additional system
is used to obtain the night-time intensity, the voltage applied to the
system for measuring the night-time intensity shall be that which
was applied to the filament lamp for measuring the day-time
intensity.(1)
D2.2.3. Where a rear position (side) lamp is reciprocally incorporated with
a dual-intensity stop lamp and is designed to operate permanently
with an additional system to regulate the intensity of the light
emitted, measurement of the light emitted shall be performed with
the same voltage applied to the system as would, if applied to the
filament lamp, enable the lamp to produce the prescribed normal
luminous flux.
D2.2.3.1 Where a position (side) lamp is reciprocally incorporated with
another lamp, and is designed to operate permanently with an
additional system to regulate the intensity of the light emitted,
measurement of the light emitted shall be performed at 6,75 V,
13.5 V or 28 V respectively, where the additional system is part of
the device.
D2.2.3.2. Where the additional system is not part of the device, then the tests
shall be performed at the rated secondary design voltage applied to
the light source. The test laboratory may require from the
manufacturer the additional system needed to regulate the light
source.
D2.2.4. The vertical and horizontal outlines of the illuminating surface of a
light-signalling device shall be determined and measured in
relation to the centre of reference.
D2.2.5. In the case of a category S3 stop lamp, which is intended to be
mounted inside the vehicle, a sample plate or sample plates (in case
of different possibilities) as supplied (see relevant para of Table 2
of this standard) shall be positioned in front of the 1amp to be
tested, in the geometrical position(s) as described in the application
drawing(s) (see relevant para of Table 2 of this standard).
(1) The functioning and installation conditions of these additional systems will
be defined by special provisions.

D2.App.2.2.1. T he direction H = 0 degrees and V = 0 degrees corresponds to the
reference axis. (On the vehicle it is horizontal, parallel to the
median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the
required direction of visibility.) It passes through the centre of
reference. The values shown in the table give, for the various
directions of measurement, the minimum intensities as a
percentage of the minimum required in the axis for each lamp (in
the direction H = 0 degrees and V = 0 degrees).
D2.App.2.2.2. W ithin the field of light distribution of paragraph D2.App.2.2.,
schematically shown as a grid, the light pattern should be
substantially uniform, i.e. the light intensity in each direction of a
part of the field formed by the grid lines shall meet at least the
lowest minimum value being shown on the grid lines surrounding
the questioned direction as a percentage.
D2.App.2.2.3. However, in the case where a device is intended to be installed at a
mounting height of equal to or less than 750 mm above the ground,
the photometric intensity is verified only up to an angle of 5
degrees downwards.
D2.App.2.3. Photometric measurement of lamps
The photometric performance shall be checked:
D2.App.2.3.1. For non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other):
with the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with
paragraph D2.2.1.1. of Annex :D2.
D2.App.2.3.2. For replaceable filament lamps:
when equipped with filament lamps at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V the
luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. The
correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux
and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage
applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of
each filament lamp used shall not deviate more than +5% from the
mean value. Alternatively a standard filament lamp may be used in
turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its reference
flux, the individual measurements in each position being added
together.
D2.App.2.3.3. F or any signaling lamp except those equipped with filament
lamp(s), the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and
after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and
maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after
one minute of operation can be calculated from the luminous
intensity distribution after 30 minutes of operation by applying at
each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV
after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation.

(1) The installation of front direction indicators of the various categories in power-driven vehicles
and their trailers is provided for in the standard concerning the installation of lighting and
light-signaling devices (AIS-008/2001 )
(2) The total value of maximum intensity for an assembly of two or more lamps is given by
multiplying by 1.4 the value prescribed for a single lamp, except for category 2a. When an
assembly of two or more lamps having the same function is deemed to be, for the purpose of
installation on a vehicle, a "single lamp" (following the definition of AIS - 008 and its
amendments in force at the time of application for type approval), this assembly shall comply
with the minimum intensity required when one lamp has failed, and, all the lamps together
shall not exceed the admissible maximum intensity (last column of the table).
In the case of a single lamp containing more than one light source:
(i) all light sources which are connected in series are considered to be one light source;
(ii) the lamp shall comply with the minimum intensity required when any one light source has
failed. However, for front or rear direction indicator lamps designed for only two light
sources, 50 % of the minimum intensity in the axis of reference of the lamp shall be
considered sufficient, provided that a note in the communication form states that the lamp
is only for use on a vehicle fitted with an operating tell-tale which indicates when any one
of these two light sources has failed.
(iii) w hen all light sources are illuminated the maximum intensity specified for a single lamp
may be exceeded provided that the single lamp is not marked "D" and the maximum
intensity specified for an assembly of two or more lamps (last column of the table) is not
exceeded.
(2) Devices which may be used as part of an assembly of two lamps
121/205

E2.1.2 Outside the reference axis, within the angular fields specified in the
arrangement diagrams in Appendix : 1 to this Annex : E2, the
intensity of the light emitted by each of the two devices supplied
must:
E2.1.2.1. In each direction corresponding to the points in the relevant table
of luminous-intensity distribution reproduced in Appendix : 2 to
this Annex : E2 ( Tables : E1 and E2), be not less than the
minimum specified in paragraph E2.1.1. above multiplied by the
percentage specified in the said table for the direction in question;
( Tables : E3, E4, E5 give required intensity values)
E2.1.2.1.1. In divergence from paragraphs E2.1.2 and E2.1.2.1, for categories
4 and 5 direction indicators, to the rear, a minimum value of 0.6 cd
is required throughout the fields specified in Appendix : 1;
E2.1.2.2. In no direction within the area from which the indicator lamp is
visible, exceed the maximum specified in paragraph E2.1.1. above;
E2.1.2.3. Moreover,
E2.1.2.3.1. Throughout the fields defined in the diagrams in Annex: E2-
Appendix :1, the intensity of the light emitted must be not less than
0.7 cd for devices of category 1b, not less than 0.3 cd for devices of
categories 1, 1a, 2a, 3, 4 towards the front and for those of category
2b by day; it shall not be less than 0.07 cd for devices of category
2b by night;
E2.1.2.3.2. For devices of categories 1 and 2b by night and, to the front, for
devices of categories 3 and 4, the intensity of the light emitted
outside the zone defined by the measuring points + 100 H and +
100V (100-field) must not exceed the following values:
Direction Indicator Maximum values in cd outside the 10 0- field
of category
Single Lamp (single) Total for the assembly
lamp marked ‘D’(1) of two lamps(1)

(1) Devices which may be used as part of an assembly of two lamps
Between the boundaries of the 100- field (+ 100H and + 100 V) and
the 50- field (+ 50 H and + 50V), the maximum admissible values
of the intensities are linearly increased up to the values as defined
in paragraph E2.1.1.
122/205
AIS-012
E2.1.2.3.3. For devices of category 1a and 1b, the intensity of the light emitted
outside the zone defined by the measuring points + 150H and + 150
V (150 field) shall not exceed the following values:
Direction indicator Maximum values in cd outside the 15 0- field
Of category
Single Lamp (single) marled Total for assembly
lamp “D”(1) of two lamps(1)
1a 250 175 350

(1) Devices which may be used as part of an assembly of two lamps
Between the boundaries of the 150 - field (+ 150 H and +150 V) and
the 50 - field (+ 50 H and + 50 V), the maximum values are
increased linearly up to the values as defined in paragraph E2.1.1.
E2.1.2.3.4. The provisions of paragraph E2.App.2.2.2 of Appendix : E2 to this
Annex : E2 on local variations of intensity must be observed.
E2.1.3. In general the intensities shall be measured with the light source(s)
continuously alight.
However, depending on the construction of the device, for
example, the use of light emitting diodes (LED), or the need to take
precautions to avoid overheating, it is allowed to measure the
lamps in flashing mode.
This must be achieved by switching with a frequency of f = 1.5 +
0.5 Hz with the pulse width greater than 0.3 s, measured at 95 per
cent peak light intensity.
In the case of replaceable filament lamps, the filament lamps shall
be operated at reference luminous flux during on time.
In all other cases the voltage as required in paragraph E2.2.1.1 shall
be switched with a rise time and fall time shorter than 0.01 s;
no overshoot is allowed. In the case of measurements taken in
flashing mode the reported luminous intensity shall be represented
by the maximum intensity.
E2.1.4. In the case of devices of category 2b the time that elapses between
electrical supply being switched on and the light output measured
on the reference axis to reach 90 % of the value measured in
accordance with paragraph E2.1.3. above shall be measured for
both the day and the night conditions of use. The time measured for
the night condition of use shall not exceed that measured for the
day condition of use.

AIS-012
E2.1.5. Appendix:2 of Annex: E2, referred to in paragraph E2.1.2.1. above,
gives particulars of the measurement methods to be used.
E2.2 TEST PROCEDURE
E2.2.1 All measurements shall be made with an uncoloured or amber-
coloured standard filament lamp of the category prescribed for the
device, the supply voltage being so regulated as to produce the
reference luminous flux prescribed for that category of lamp.
E2.2.1.1 All measurements on lamps equipped with non-replaceable light
sources (filament lamps and other) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V
or 28.0 V respectively.
In the case of light sources supplied by a special power supply, the
above test voltages shall be applied to the input terminals of that
power supply. The test laboratory may require from the
manufacturer the special power supply needed to supply the light
sources.
E2.2.2. However, in the case of an indicator of category 2b for which an
additional system (1) is used to obtain the night-time intensity, the
voltage applied to the system for measuring the night-time intensity
shall be that which was applied to the filament lamp for
E2.2.3. The vertical and horizontal outlines of the illuminating surface of a
light-signalling device shall be determined and measured in
relation to the centre of reference.
(1) The functioning and installation conditions of this additional device will be
defined by special provisions measuring the day-time intensity.

with the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with
paragraph E2.2.1.1. of Annex : E2.
E2.App.2.3.2. For replaceable filament lamps:
When equipped with filament lamps at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V,
the luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. The
correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux
and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage
applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of
each filament lamp used shall not deviate more than + 5 % from
the mean value. Alternatively a standard filament lamp may be
used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its
reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being
added together.
E2.App.2.3.3. F or any direction indicator lamp except those equipped with
filament lamp(s), the luminous intensities measured after one
minute and after 30 minutes of operation in flashing mode
(f = 1.5 Hz, duty factor 50 %), shall comply with the minimum and
maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after
one minute of operation can be calculated by applying at each test
point the ratio of luminous intensity measured in HV after one
minute and after 30 minutes of operation as above described.

G2.App.2.2.1. T he direction H = 0 degrees and V = 0 degrees corresponds to the
reference axis. (On the vehicle it is horizontal, parallel to the
median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the
required direction of visibility). It passes through the centre of
reference. The values shown in the table give, for the various
directions of measurements, the minimum intensities as a
percentage of the minimum required in the axis for each lamp (in
the direction H = 0 degrees and V = 0 degrees).
G2.App.2.2.2. W ithin the field of light distribution of paragraph G2.App.2.2., of
Appendix :2 to Annex :G2 schematically shown as a grid, the light
pattern should be substantially uniform in so far as the light
intensity in each direction of a part of the field formed by the grid
lines meets at least the lowest minimum percentage value being
shown (available) on the grid lines surrounding the questioned
direction.
G2.App.2.2.3. H owever in the case where a device is intended to be installed at a
mounting height of equal to or less than 750 mm above the ground,
the photometric intensity is verified only up to an angle of 50
downwards.
G2.App.2.3. Photometric measurement of lamps
The photometric performance shall be checked:
G2.App.2.3.1. F or non-replaceable light sources (filament lamps and other): with
the light sources present in the lamp, in accordance with
paragraph G2.2.1. of Annex:G2.
G2.App.2.3.2. For replaceable filament lamps:
when equipped with filament lamps at 6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V the
luminous intensity values produced shall be corrected. The
correction factor is the ratio between the reference luminous flux
and the mean value of the luminous flux found at the voltage
applied (6.75 V, 13.5 V or 28.0 V). The actual luminous fluxes of
each filament lamp used shall not deviate more than + 5 % from
the mean value. Alternatively a standard filament lamp may be
used in turn, in each of the individual positions, operated at its
reference flux, the individual measurements in each position being
added together.
G2.App.2.3.3. F or any signaling lamp except those equipped with filament
lamp(s), the luminous intensities, measured after one minute and
after 30 minutes of operation, shall comply with the minimum and
maximum requirements. The luminous intensity distribution after
one minute of operation can be calculated from the luminous
intensity distribution after 30 minutes of operation by applying at
each test point the ratio of luminous intensities measured at HV
after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation.

K1. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
K1.1. Each sample shall conform to the lighting specifications set forth in
a paragraph K4 below.(1)
Illuminating devices must be so designed that the entire surface to
be illuminated is visible from the rear within the field of vision
indicated in the drawing in Annex :K2.
K1.2. All measurements shall be carried out by adjusting the lamp or
lamps of the illuminating device to the minimum light flux
prescribed for the test voltage in the specification of the lamp or
lamps for the device.
K1.2.1. All measurements on lamps equipped with non-replaceable light
sources (filament lamps and other) shall be made at 6.75 V, 13.5 V
or 28.0 V respectively.
In the case of light sources supplied by a special power supply, the
above test voltages shall be applied to the input terminals of that
power supply. The test laboratory may require from the

K1.3. For any rear registration plate( mark ) illuminating device, except
those equipped with filament lamp(s), the luminance values
measured after one minute and after 30 minutes of operation shall
comply with the minimum requirements.
T h e luminance distribution after one minute of operation can be
calculated by applying at each test point the ratio of luminance
values measured in one point after one minute and after 30 minutes
of operation.
K2. COLOUR OF LIGHT
The light of the lamp used in the illuminating device must be
sufficiently colourless not to cause any appreciable change in the
colour of the registration plate.
(1) These specifications are such as to ensure good visibility if the inclination of the
registration plate does not exceed 30 degrees on either side of the vertical.
183/205
AIS-012
K3. MEASURING PROCEDURE
Luminance measurements shall be made on a piece of clean white
blotting paper with a minimum diffuse reflection factor of 70%, of
the same dimensions as the registration plate, placed in the position
normally occupied by it and 2 mm in front of its holder.
Luminance measurements shall be made perpendicularly to the
surface of the paper, at the points shown in Annex :K3 according to
the type of plate for which the device is intended, each point
representing a circular area 25 mm in diameter.
K4. PHOTOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS
At each of the points of measurement shown in Annex : K3, the
luminance B shall be at least equal to 2.5 cd/m2. The gradient of
the luminance between the values B1 and B2, measured at any two
points 1 and 2 selected from among those mentioned above, shall
not exceed 2 x Bo/cm, Bo being the minimum luminance measured
at the various points, that is to say:
K5. ANGLE OF INCIDENCE
The manufacturer of the illuminating device shall specify one or
more or field of position in which the device is to be fitted in
relation to the space for the registration plate; when the lamp is
placed in the position(s) specified by the manufacturer the angle
of incidence of the light on the surface of the plate does not
exceed 82° at any point on the surface to be illuminated, this angle
being measured from the extremity of the device's illuminating area
which is furthest from the surface of the plate. If there is more than
one illuminating device, the foregoing requirement shall apply only
to that part of the plate intended to be illuminated by the device
concerned.
The device must be so designed that no light is emitted directly
towards the rear, with the exception of red light if the device is
combined or grouped with a rear lamp.

L3.2 Procedure
The nozzle for atomizing the salt solution shall be adjusted for maximum
amount of spray. The pressure of the solution shall be maintained between 29
and 33 kPa. The test piece shall be sprayed in the chamber with 5% solution
of sodium chloride in water at the standard temperature of 27 ± 2o C for 50
hours consisting of two periods, each period being of 24 hours of
spraying and one hour of draining. The pH of the salt solution shall be such
that the collected solution will be in the pH range of 6.5 to 7.2.
L3.3 The unit under test shall not show a corrosion which shows a change of more
than 10% variation in the unfavorable direction, in the photometry requirements
as specified in the relevant Annexes.
L4.0 Dust Test for Seals & Gaskets
L4.1 A sample unit with any drain hole closed shall be mounted in its normal
operating position 150 mm from the wall in a box measuring 900 mm in all
directions, containing 5 kg of fine powdered cement.
At intervals of 15 minutes this dust shall be agitated by compressed air or fan
blower by projecting blasts of air for a two second period in downward
direction into the dust in such a way that the dust shall be completely and
uniformly diffused throughout the entire cube. The dust is then allowed to
settle.
In the meantime, the lamp is operated at the rated voltage continuously with an
operating cycle of 30 minutes (15 min. ON and 15 min. OFF).
This test shall be continued for 5 hrs.
L4.2 After this test, the exterior surface of the unit shall be cleaned and the
photometric test repeated and if the maximum intensity is within 10% of the
maximum value found in the photometric test, it shall be considered adequately
dust tight.
L5.0 Moisture Test for Adequate Drainage
L5.1 A sample unit shall be mounted in its normal operating position with all drain
holes open and subjected to a precipitation of 2.5 mm of water per minute
delivered at an angle of 45 degrees from a nozzle with a solid cone spray. The
rate of water spray shall be measured by the rise of water in small straight sided
pan placed horizontally and completely within the area covered by the water
spray. During the moisture test, the unit shall revolve about its vertical axis at a
rate of 4 rev/min. This test shall be continued for 12 hours. The water be then
be turned off and the unit permitted to drain for 1 hour.
L5.2 After the test, unit under test shall not accumulate moisture in excess of 2 ml.
L6.0 Thermal Shock Resistance T est
L6.1 A sample unit shall be connected for not less than 15 minutes with the filament
at 7, 14 and 28 V for rated voltages of 6, 12 and 24 V respectively in its normal
operating position in an ambient temperature of approximately 27oC.
It shall then be disconnected and immediately plunged into water at 5oC below
the ambient such that the lens comes in contact with water.
L6.2 After the test, no cracking or fracture of the lens shall occur.
