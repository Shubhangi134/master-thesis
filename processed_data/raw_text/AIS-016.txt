Introduction
The Automotive Industries Standards Committee (AISC) functions under the guidance of
CMVR Technical Standing Committee. AISC is setup to assist the Automotive Industry
as well as Government of India in the preparation of new standards and review of the
existing standards. ARAI acts as the Secretariat for AISC.
Seats, seat belts, seat belt anchorages, etc., are safety critical items for the passenger in
case of sudden acceleration/deceleration and accidents. Further, seats and their design,
mounting, etc., constitute substantially to the ride comfort of the vehicle users. Presently
there are no Indian standards or CMVR covering the seats and related items. AISC
identified these as one of the priority items and a series of standards are being drafted by
a Panel. This standard is one of them.
This standard on seats for M1 category vehicles is based on ECE R-17.07 (April 2000)
and 74/408/EEC as amended by 96/37/EEC. As seen, the ECE R-17 has been amended
7 times and 07 Series of amendments has come into force from January 2000 and this
requirement is yet to be covered by EEC. Considering that the requirements of seats is
being introduced for the first time in India and Series 07 amendments may require
substantial design changes both on the seat and the vehicle; and EEC may also undergo
changes as it has been recently introduced, the Panel recommends that implementation of
all the requirements except para 5.9 (luggage retention), can be planned earlier while the
implementation of 5.9 be given appropriate additional lead time.
The Panel responsible for preparation of the standard is given in Annexure-II.
Annexure-III gives the list of the members of AISC.

AIS-016/2000
5.4.2 Test Procedure
5.4.2.1 All lines including the projections of the reference line, shall be drawn in the
vertical median plane of the seat or seating position concerned (see Fig.1).
5.4.2.2 The displaced reference line is determined by applying to the part simulating
the back of the manikin referred to in IS:13749-1993, an initial force
producing a rearward moment of 373 Nm about the R point.
5.4.2.3 By means of a spherical head form 165 mm in diameter, an initial force
producing a moment of 373 Nm about the R point is applied at right angles to
the displaced reference line at a distance of 65 mm below the top of the head
restraint, the reference line being kept in its displaced position in accordance
with para 5.4.2.2.
5.4.2.4 If the presence of the gaps prevents the application of the force prescribed in
para 5.4.2.3 at 65 mm from the top of the head restraint, the distance may be
reduced so that the axis of the force passes through the center line of the
frame element nearest to the gap.
5.4.2.5 In the cases described in para 4.6 and 4.7 above, the test shall be repeated by
applying to each gap, using a sphere of 165 mm in diameter, a force passing
through the center of gravity of the smallest of the sections of the gap,
along transversal plane parallel to the reference line, and reproducing a
moment of 373 Nm about the R point.
5.4.2.6 The tangent Y to the spherical head form, parallel to the displaced reference
line is determined.
5.4.2.7 The distance X, provided for in para 4.7 above, between the tangent Y and
the displaced reference line is measured.
5.4.2.8 To check the strength of the head restraint, the initial load specified in para
5.4.2.3 and 5.4.2.5 are increased to 890 Nm unless the breakage of the seat or
seat-back occurs earlier.
5.5 Determination of the Height of the Head Restraint (see Fig.5)
5.5.1 All lines, including the projection of the reference line, shall be drawn in the
vertical median plane of the seat or seating position concerned, the
intersection of such plane with the seat determining the contour of the head
restraint and of the seat back (see Fig.5).

plane perpendicular to the reference line 635 mm above the R point of the
seat, this distance being measured along the reference line.
5.7 Determination of Distance “a” of Head Restraint Gaps (see Fig.2 and Fig.3)
5.7.1 The distance “a” shall be determined for each gap and in relation to the front
face of the head restraint, by means of a sphere having a diameter of 165
mm.
5.7.2 The sphere shall be put into contact with the gap in a point of the gap area
which allows the maximum sphere intrusion, considering no load is to be
applied;
5.7.3 The distance between the two points of contact of the sphere with the gap
will constitute the distance “a” to be considered for the evaluation of the
provisions under para 4.6.
5.8 Tests for Checking Energy Dissipation on the Seat-back and Head Restraint
5.8.1 The surfaces of the rear parts of seats to be checked are those situated in the

5.9.2 Test Preparation
The details of test preparation and set-ups for various configurations are
explained below.
5.9.3 Test of Seat Backs (see Fig.7)
5.9.3.1 General Requirements
Two numbers of Type 1 test blocks shall be placed on the floor of the luggage
compartment. In order to determine the location of the test blocks in the
longitudinal direction, they shall first be positioned such that their front side
contacts that part of the vehicle which constitutes the forward boundary of the
luggage compartment and that their lower side rests on the floor of the
luggage compartment. They shall then be moved backwards and parallel to
the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle until their geometrical centre has
transversed a horizontal distance of 200 mm. If the dimensions of the
luggage compartment do not allow a distance of 200 mm and if the rear seats
are horizontally adjustable, these seats shall be moved forward to the limit of
the adjustment range intended for normal occupant use, or to the position
resulting in a distance of 200 mm, whichever is less. In other cases, the test
blocks shall be placed as far as possible behind the rear seats. The distance
between the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle and the inward facing
side of each test block shall be 25 mm to obtain a distance of 50 mm between
both blocks.
During the test, the seats must be adjusted to ensure that the locking system
cannot be released by external factors. If applicable, the seats shall be
adjusted as follows:
The longitudinal adjustment shall be secured one notch or 10 mm in front of
the rearmost possible position of use specified by the manufacturer (for seats
with independent vertical adjustment, the cushion shall be placed to its lowest
possible position). The test shall be carried out with the seat backs in their
normal position of use.
If the seat back is fitted with a headrest, the test must be carried out with the
headrest placed in the highest position, if adjustable.
If the back(s) of the rear seat(s) can be folded down, they shall be secured in
their upright normal position by the standard locking mechanism.
Seats behind which the Type 1 blocks cannot be installed are exempted from
this test.
17
AIS-016/2000
5.9.3.2 Vehicles with More Than Two Rows of Seats
If the rearmost row of seats is removable and/or can be folded down by the
user according to the manufacturer’s instructions in order to increase the
luggage compartment area, then the seat row immediately in front of this
rearmost row shall also be tested. However, in this case, the test agency, after
consultation with the manufacturer, may decide not to test one of the two
rearmost rows of seats if the seats and their attachments are of similar design
and if the test requirement of 200 mm is respected. When there is a gap,
allowing sliding of one Type 1 block past the seats, then the test loads (two
numbers of Type 1 blocks) shall be installed behind the seats after agreement
between the test agency and the manufacturer. The exact test configuration
shall be noted in the test report.
5.9.3.4 Test of Partitioning Systems
For the test of the partitioning systems above the seat backs, the vehicle shall
be fitted with a fixed raised test floor having a load surface that locates the
centre of gravity of the test block centrally between the top edge of the
bordering seat back (without taking into account the headrests) and the
bottom edge of the roof lining. A Type 2 test block is placed on the raised
test floor with its largest surface 500 mm x 350 mm, centrally in relation to
the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and with its surface 500 mm x 125 mm to
the front. Partitioning systems behind which the Type 2 test block cannot be
installed are exempted from this test. The test block is placed directly in
contact with the partitioning system. In addition, two numbers of Type 1 test
blocks are positioned in accordance with para 5.9.3.1 in order to perform a
simultaneous test on the seat backs (see Fig.8).
If the seat back is fitted with a headrest, the test must be carried out with the
headrest placed in the highest position, if adjustable.
5.9.4 Dynamic Testing of Seatbacks and Partitioning Systems used as Luggage
Restraint Systems
The body of the passenger car shall be anchored securely to a test sled, and
this anchorage shall not act as reinforcement for seat backs and the
partitioning system. After the installation of the test blocks as described in
para 5.9.3.1 or 5.9.3.2, the passenger car body shall be accelerated as shown
in Fig.8. With the agreement of the manufacturer, the above described test
pulse corridor can be used alternatively to fulfil the test of the seat strength
according to para 5.3.1.
5.10 If a test method other than those specified in para 5.2 to 5.9 above is used, its
equivalence shall be proved.
6. EXPLANATORY NOTE
This is based on ECE R 17-07 “Approval of Seats, Anchorages and Head
Restraints” and 74/408/EEC as amended by 96/37 “Strength of Seats and
Their Anchorages”.
